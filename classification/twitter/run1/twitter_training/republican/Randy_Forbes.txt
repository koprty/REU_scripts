Regardless of the cause of this crash-- we need to be better equipping our men &amp; women in uniform so they can keep us safe &amp; come home safe. 
Our pilots aren't getting the flying time they need to build their skills. 
Only 1 in 4 Navy fighters is ready for combat. Of our older strike fighters, 1 in 2 is grounded due to a shortage of parts and maintenance. 
In a hearing on Navy readiness challenges right now, as we learn this news. Pilots are being flown to the hospital. https://t.co/hVksLfxln0
