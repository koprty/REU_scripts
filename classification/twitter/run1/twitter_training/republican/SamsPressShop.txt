NOW ACCEPTING NOMINATIONS: Nominate a veteran you know for the 2016 Congressional Veterans Commendation https://t.co/dWgof9RKgB 
As a veteran of two wars, I can tell you that our servicemembers should not be penalized when it comes to saving for their retirement. 
...The IRS already allows this for state &amp; local workers and teachers. Our servicemembers should be given the same choice. 
My bill would allow these Servicemembers to contribute the max to both their civilian 401(k) AND military TSP! 
You see, the IRS caps the amount an individual can save for their retirement through work. That's where my bill comes into play! 
...as a result, they don't get the TSP match to help make up for the reduction in pensions bc of the IRS. 
......guard &amp; reserve forces who contribute the max $$ possible in their civilian jobs can't then participate in the TSP... 
Unfortunately these reforms may harm guard &amp; reserve forces who happen to also participate in the retirement plan at their civilian jobs 
...BUT it also included a 1st time ever match for Servicemember's retirement contributions in their TSP... 
...ICYMI, last yr's Defense Authorization included significant retirement reforms, including a reduction in military pension... 
I just discussed the importance of my bill, The Servicemember Retirement Improvement Act, at @WaysandMeansGOP hearing...

@jasonyaworske my legislation saves taxpayers’ $$ by stopping illegals from getting the $1,000 refundable child tax credit 
It’s clear the current SS WEP &amp; GPO aren’t working, &amp; the time to act is NOW. 
Dr. Fichtner ALSO confirmed @RepKevinBrady WEP solution would help BOTH new &amp; current beneficiaries but @BarackObama’s proposal would NOT.
