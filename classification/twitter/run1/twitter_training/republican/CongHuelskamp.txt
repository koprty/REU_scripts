Praying for those affected by the severe weather in Kansas over the last couple days. https://t.co/x460tkAvCZ 
Honored to fly with Honor Flight 37 from Kansas. #Veterans https://t.co/Y7tJbPnSZg 
About time we held someone accountable for possibly worst presidency ever. #IRS #Impeach #ImpeachKoskinen https://t.co/QXvP9jZGIa 
It seems VA kicked ~4,200 #Veterans off wait lists by declaring them dead. #VAAccountability #VAIncompetence https://t.co/MQHt2wnv8P 
Just met Kansas #Veterans on an Honor Flight. They are offended by #VA Secretary’s heartless and damaging comments about wait times. 
I'm praying for those impacted by the tornadoes at home in Kansas. 
Obama has already added a record 20,642 regulations – and he’s not done yet. #RegulationNation https://t.co/T26bxyh3G1 
No employees died from dangerous chemicals at FL @PPFA, though Planned Parenthood kills thousands of babies with them every year. #prolife 
#Impeach #IRS Commissioner. He testified under oath that he'd turn over all of Lois Lerner's emails, knowing thousands had been destroyed. 
Customer wait times are more important at @Disney than #Veterans' wait times are at Obama’s VA. #VAAccountability https://t.co/fjAjCQlQqo 
RT @freedomcaucus: Why the Impeachment Of #IRS Commissioner Is A Sign That Congress Might Actually Work https://t.co/Y91XPTlaEG 
On McDonald's Disney/#VA analogy: #Veterans died awaiting life-saving care, not waiting on Mickey Mouse. 
Title IX doesn't give men rights to shower + change clothes in women’s restrooms or locker rooms. #bathroomprivacy https://t.co/uJU1lfKmLf 
Thank you, brave men and women serving in our #ArmedForces. Especially those at @FortRiley! #ArmedForcesDay https://t.co/QIkkv1KCqw 
.@MileyCyrus advertises shirts that promote killing babies. @JimmyFallon promotes her promoting it. @PPFA #prolife https://t.co/gKFCLF8v46 
Obama is now demanding we pay for abortions and “sex changes." And then that anyone can go into girls’ bathroom. https://t.co/sfM8FirBIx 
This should never happen. Paying a convicted child molester to retire. #EPA https://t.co/4ikVcKRQT5 
Lame-duck legacy: Obama’s rushing through dozens of new rules and killing thousands of American jobs. https://t.co/43dQunjhzN
