POTUS checklist: 
1. Offend our ally Israel
2. Delay the #Zika response
3. Add $1B to our debt
That is a busy month. https://t.co/5hyhNCLFxE 
The @okcthunder take game 4 and lead the series 3-1. Only 1 win away from #NBAFinals2016                          #ThunderUp #ThunderNation 
.@FoxNews reports about @SenatorKirk &amp; my #NDAA amendment to prevent #GITMO detainees from re-entering the fight: https://t.co/c58zPkEkan 
My #NDAA amendment w/ @SenatorKirk will cut foreign aid for nations who lose track of released #Gitmo terrorists. https://t.co/MEfFiqd7l2 
You can't make this stuff up → POTUS prioritizes #climatechange over protecting the American people from #Zika. https://t.co/5hyhNCLFxE 
Not a joke → VA Sec compares waiting in line for care at the VA to waiting in line at Disneyland. Unbelievable. https://t.co/EKOVyhfyBT

To all the men and women who have worn the uniform--thank you for your service to our nation. Happy #ArmedForcesDay! https://t.co/0483wrPb3W 
The Senate could have used unobligated, already appropriated dollars for #Zika, but instead added $1.1B in new debt. That is poor governing. 
#Zika bill is fiscally irresponsible &amp; spends more than the agreed-upon budget caps. What's the purpose of a budget if we can't stick to it?

There is no reason to add $1.1B to the debt when there are unobligated, already existing funds to use for #Zika. https://t.co/vaCJTs8zTn 
Great to see @CityofBA Mayor Thurmond this morning at my weekly constituent coffee hour, Java with James! https://t.co/J8Xjoqiea5
