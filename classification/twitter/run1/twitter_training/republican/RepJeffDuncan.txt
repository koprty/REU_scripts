.@JTDAVIS928 @turnbul04 it has passed house. Dems filibustering in Senate and President has threatened a veto. 
.@JTDAVIS928 @turnbul04 we spend several billion a year giving child tax credit refunds to illegal immigrants. That would be a good start. 
.@turnbul04 I don't like the idea of having to go further in debt every time something like this comes up. Prioritization is key. 
.@turnbul04 its also important to prioritize. If Zika is a big concern, we should be willing to cut funding from other things to fund it. 
.@turnbul04 zika is a concern. Congress should address at the funding &amp; regulatory level. Regulatory think FDA and EPA (skeeter spraying) 
Congrats to @ClemsonTigers @ClemsonBaseball on the big win vs Louisville!  #GoTigers!

@RODNEYSTPEARSON @DeptVetAffairs I support that but a lot of vets don't. If we had more vet support on the issue we could make it happen! 
If we keep chipping away at the 4th Amendment, one day, it won't be there. #BillOfRights #4thAmendment #Liberty #Don'tTradeLiberty4Security 
.@DeptVetAffairs people don't die because of wait times at Disneyland, but they can when waiting for medical care from the VA. Apologize now
