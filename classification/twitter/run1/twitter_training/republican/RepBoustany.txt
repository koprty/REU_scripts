I offered an amendment supporting #Israel &amp; repudiating @UN meddling. US must stand with our ally. https://t.co/4pcAmIKJ3F 
.@UN telling #Israel to surrender Golan Heights while Syria is plunged into civil war is overreach &amp; irresponsible. https://t.co/4pcAmIKJ3F 
In the Middle East, #Israel is a stabilizing force - it's not the problem. The @UN should act like it. https://t.co/4pcAmIKJ3F
