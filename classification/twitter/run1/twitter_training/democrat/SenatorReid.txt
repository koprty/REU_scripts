RT @SenateDems: LIVE: Democrats demand Republicans cancel the upcoming recess and do their jobs. https://t.co/j8rkFKQkQT 
Mosquitoes don’t go on recess in the summer. The Republican Congress is prepared to, without taking action on Zika. https://t.co/Lfd1ohMAyM 
During the few weeks we're in session, we barely work 2.5 days a week. #DoYourJob https://t.co/c2UChSWAbx 
The Republican Senate doesn't work. It's pathetic how light our schedule is. https://t.co/INKzluuDRx 
For 70 days, Senate Republicans have refused to do anything to move along Merrick Garland’s nomination. https://t.co/FB0y7i3Uhq

The U.S. should be a leader, not a bystander, in the fight to end the heinous practice of female genital mutilation. https://t.co/4LNTG61Dem 
Senators will regret that they did not act more quickly to address Zika if we don’t provide the money experts need. The time to act is now. 
RT @SenateDems: In 62 days, Chief Justice Roberts was confirmed by the Senate. Meanwhile, Garland can't get a hearing. #DoYourJob https://t… 
RT @ACLU: Thank you @SenatorReid for standing up for transgender people and against discrimination in North Carolina! #HB2 
I stand with the transgender community in NC who are targets of state-sponsored discrimination. We must stand up for those who are bullied. 
When deciding how much money to fight Zika, it's simple: let's listen to what public health experts say they need. https://t.co/kYp8BoY7XK 
Senate Republicans, do your job and give Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. https://t.co/XSOYIgYKp9 
RT @SenateDems: Editorial: Grassley's court maneuver threatens his legacy, reputation https://t.co/FAStB3DODy 
I hope the administration reconsiders these raids. We must address the violence that forces families to leave Central America. 
Agreed, Senator McConnell. When are the Garland hearings? #DoYourJob  https://t.co/g3eCX9FM5W 
Senator Grassley has changed: https://t.co/hwoKjmBfwD https://t.co/qsGMaTgTcn 
Sen. McConnell should be giddy about a Trump presidency. It's everything he and his Party have wrought. 
I stand with Iowans who are telling @ChuckGrassley to #DoYourJob. https://t.co/bUhjdt3WcF
