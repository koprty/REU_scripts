They put their lives on the line for us each and every day, so I want to do all that I can to fully support their important mission. #Police 
Federal funding is needed to meet the increased demands being placed on  our nation's #lawenforcement and #firstresponders. 
Last year, this program helped #lawenforcement organizations across the country acquire 38,245 of these potentially life-saving vests. 
#Legislation I cosponsored that helps state and local #police purchase  bullletproof vests has been approved in the House. 
It is residents who #volunteer their time and talents who make #communities like #LaGrange great.
