Moms and babies are counting on us to keep them safe. We cannot be caught flat footed in the Fight against #Zika. https://t.co/JshQfy5qOW 
For Republicans to go home before #MemorialDay without dealing with #Zika is incredibly irresponsible. 
Republicans in Washington talk tough about keeping America safe. But with #Zika, they have no sense of urgency. Delay, delay, delay. 
Good luck in the final four, @LaithAlSaadi!  We’re rooting for you tonight #Michigan

#ZikaVirus is coming, but we are far from ready https://t.co/RSAERK6NYx

Watch LIVE as @SenateDems review Judge Garland's credentials. No excuses. Just #DoYourJob.

.@SCOTUSnom Judge Garland’s lifetime of public service merit a hearing &amp; vote, not GOP obstruction. #DoYourJob 
#OTD in 1954, #BrownVBoard outlawed segregation and found that “separate but equal” has no place in our schools. 
Expanding @EasternMarket will help more entrepreneurs create jobs and sell Michigan products.

I agree with the @NYTimes Ed Board: every day that passes without a ninth justice undermines #SCOTUS. #DoYourJob

Senate voting today on funding to combat #ZikaVirus. We must act to prevent families &amp; children from being harmed.

No wonder it took 3 months for @SenateGOP to do anything on Zika. This is why! https://t.co/srgriEivn5
