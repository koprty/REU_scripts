RT @SelectPanelDems: 'We lose money doing this': Tiny company caught in abortion debate takes on Congress https://t.co/2KnNfKg6lk 
#DoYourJob, @SpeakerRyan! Simply astonishing to send House home without meaningfully addressing #Zika, opioid &amp; #FlintWaterCrisis issues. 
GOP once again chose hatred over #LGBT equality, but Dems won’t let Congress be an agent of bigotry https://t.co/Hf6TU0LKPX 
On #NationalWineDay, I raise a glass to CO vineyards growing the best and highest elevation wine in America. Cheers! https://t.co/ROPRZAxpaI 
Unacceptable: Outdated law means many toxic chemicals aren't facing rigorous EPA scrutiny. High time to reform #TSCA https://t.co/EVtjxmqV8b 
Are these tragedies preventable? @NHTSAgov - I'm demanding answers about safety of front seats in cars. https://t.co/orOR9EKg1j 
@speakerryan’s committee to attack #womenshealth has no basis in fact. It’s time. #disbandit https://t.co/jrH17hSvYf https://t.co/CECcBc5UCq 
Endangering medical providers &amp; patients to score political points is irresponsible &amp; wrong https://t.co/jrH17hSvYf https://t.co/QCtdvZ1D6z 
.@SpeakerRyan, we need to fully fund @POTUS' emergency request for new funds to address the #Zika virus threat. https://t.co/EGKjLLaazp 
Article in @Rewire_News shows how GOP attacks women's health w/ false narrative- good read!  https://t.co/w4Mvq2ozC2 https://t.co/x4gnY4iKRl 
We can’t let @NFL tamper w/ critical study in sports injury. Kudos to @NIH for rejecting big $$ to stay impartial.  https://t.co/QHKHog9Wrr 
Troubling news today from @CDCgov. We need sufficient funding for #Zika response NOW. https://t.co/p7Afg39OoZ 
Another blatant attack on #WomensHealth. Tell @GovMaryFallin this is not #OK https://t.co/L4d8hCZK7R https://t.co/33Rff4gTRl 
As #Denver tops the US Census list of booming cities, smart growth is key to our future. #environment #housing https://t.co/B8BJ7EODSA 
Claiming regular order while extending a vote 8 minutes to stop #LGBT #Equality is the height of hypocrisy. #SHAME https://t.co/4ON1rbENe0 
Strong-arming by @HouseGOP on this vote will deprive #LGBT workers’ rights.  #DISGRACE

Protect U.S. families from #Zika with the needed funds this week, @HouseGOP, not Oct 1 as you now propose.  #newborns #microcephaly 
RT @WhiteHouse: FACT: 56% of Americans who will benefit from #overtime expansion are women. https://t.co/J4K6m3B6t5 https://t.co/uJSjdHbArc 
The current @HouseGOP #Zika virus bill is short on resources and raids the Ebola fund. We can do better! https://t.co/lBpUxUl1C6
