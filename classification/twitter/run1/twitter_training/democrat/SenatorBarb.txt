Orgs like @BmoreStation helping veterans who deserve a helping hand get back on their feet &amp; put a roof over their heads. 
I'm continuing to fight to ensure veterans get care, support &amp; benefits they have earned &amp; deserve for serving our country. 
I've always believed support for our military in field must be matched by support for our veterans at home. 
Headed to @BmoreStation to meet w veterans &amp; announce Congress moving ahead federal funds to reduce veteran homelessness.

If #WASP were good enough to fly for US, risk their lives &amp; earn Cong Gold Medal, they’re good enough for Arlington. https://t.co/UfRdPQoR56 
I intro’d bipartisan bill w/ @SenJoniErnst, @RepMcSally &amp; @RepSusanDavis to restore high honor #WASP earned &amp; deserve. 
Today we have righted a terrible wrong so #WASP can once &amp; for all be laid to rest alongside our nation’s patriots at Arlington. 
So pleased @POTUS today signed into law bipartisan measure to restore inurnment rights for WWII #WASP at Arlington Nat’l Cemetery. 
Glad to join @TVP_info’s @DorotaWSch to talk my Polish roots &amp; continued work to strengthen US/Poland relationship. https://t.co/uStIcf4Qrv

I fought to ensure women included in research @NIH &amp;worked to establish Office of Research on Women’s Health. We must keep up the fight. 
Agree w/ @BarbraStreisand &amp; Ronald Perelman-US must end gender bias in medical research. https://t.co/Sdg4qNoEI4 @FightLadyKiller 
Today’s action will help those trying to get to the middle class get there, &amp; help those already in middle class stay there. 
Millions of Americans are working overtime but aren’t being paid their fair share. Full-time job shouldn’t mean full-time poverty. 
I applaud President’s action to increase access to overtime pay for millions of Americans, including 80K MDers. https://t.co/837FXBMKlL 
Sen. GOP Leader McConnell says ‘elections not excuse not to do our work.' Couldn’t agree more. #DoYourJob https://t.co/BosWos57zH 
Judge Garland nominated over 2 months ago, Senate GOP should #DoYourJob &amp; hold a hearing &amp; up or down vote. 
Pres Obama fulfilled his Constitutional duty nominating Judge Merrick Garland to serve on Supreme Court. Time for Congress to #DoYourJob
