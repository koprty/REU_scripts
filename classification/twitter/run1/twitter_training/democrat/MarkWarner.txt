Intro'd an #NDAA amdt with @SteveDaines to elevate CYBERCOM to a combatant command, allow us to better engage with 21st century cyber threat 
Applaud @GovernorVA on this move. Functional safety oversight of #WMATA needs to be a regional priority.  https://t.co/Bb2YnvSDFs 
Pleased that the Senate has finally voted to repeal the wasteful, duplicative catfish inspection program. House should now do the same. 
My proposal w/@RandPaul to encourage federal employees 2 report wasteful end-of-year spending, Bonuses 4 Cost Cutters, just passed Committee 
Love that you're doing this! Important perspective. #wusa9onmetro  https://t.co/4suQnq7oeO 
So 14 colleagues &amp; I are pushing Congress to act NOW on these 18 leases so vets can access timely quality care https://t.co/2hcB5KZUD2 (5/5) 
The Hampton V-A is managing a patient workload that has grown at 4x the national avg. Congress needs to approve that outpatient lease. (4/5) 
One project stuck in limbo is a 155,000 sq ft outpatient facility in #HRVA, which has 1 of the fastest-growing vets pop. in the country (3/) 
There are 18 medical leases that have been awaiting congressional action for more than a year, hampering V-A's ability to provide care (/2) 
Congress hasn't authorized any @DeptVetAffairs medical leases in almost 2 years. That's a big problem for our vets' access to care. (1/)
