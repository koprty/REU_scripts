Why would many in Congress STILL condone flying a symbol of treason over VA cemeteries? Must read by @JoeDavidsonWP https://t.co/RAMvjwGLLZ 
Over 150 yrs ago, slavery was abolished- why in 2016 would we fly this hateful symbol over VA cemeteries? https://t.co/iD7RW6BKoX 
It's past time the VA ended the promotion of legacy of the Confederacy. Let’s move towards justice &amp; unity.  https://t.co/4eeVGBFDYO

Thanks to all who voted to end flying confederate flags at VA cemeteries. 159(!!!) opposed but 265 - both sides of the aisle - agreed. 
Today’s vote to ban confederate flags at VA cemeteries is progress – but too many still on the wrong side of history https://t.co/y7BH45Vj6T

Did you know Confederate flags are still allowed to fly over VA cemeteries? Voting soon on my amendment to stop this https://t.co/NLlvkHN6pQ
