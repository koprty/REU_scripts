We’ll gear up &amp; fight back, like we’ve done so many times before. We won’t let the @CFPB be destroyed by Wall St &amp; their Washington friends. 
The @CFPB has handled 900k complaints &amp; forced big banks to return $11B to people they cheated. @HouseGOP can’t stand gov that works. 
.@HouseAppropsGOP voted today to hamstring the @CFPB &amp; make it tougher for the cops on Wall Street to do their jobs. 
Student loans make it tough for ppl to buy homes. Thrilled @nardotrealtor supports my #bankonstudents refi bill. https://t.co/HbGNXlhi6r

Watch my speech calling on senators to vote down this terrible idea to roll back new retirement protections: https://t.co/IeFMreInUL 
Yesterday I reminded the @SenateGOP: We weren’t sent here to work for Wall Street &amp; their armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists. 
Today the @SenateGOP is voting for a proposal to make it EASIER for Wall Street to cheat Americans out of the retirement savings. 
This @BostonGlobe story shows that the student debt crisis is real – and it's even worse than we imagined. https://t.co/o5A0bzg21E

Change won’t be easy – but we don’t get what we don’t fight for. America’s workers are worth fighting for. #itspersonal 
Most workers aren’t asking for the moon. They just want some security. That’s America's promise, but not without real changes. #itspersonal 
Unions helped build America’s middle class, and unions can help rebuild it. #itspersonal https://t.co/pJARrL7IdY 
We should create legal &amp; regulatory certainty in the labor market. #itspersonal https://t.co/y43l7crfMz 
Employee benefits should follow that worker wherever he/she goes. #itspersonal https://t.co/pxcoa3BOdL 
Any worker should be able to stay home when sick or care for a sick baby without going hungry. #itspersonal https://t.co/zFWrVUQHuA 
Workers with serious accidents or illnesses that get knocked out of work need a backstop. #itspersonal https://t.co/SQkdwyXKTU 
Workers w/o employers have a challenge paying into Social Security – affecting disability &amp; retirement. #itspersonal https://t.co/yrbqfkRTeX 
Start with 1 simple principle: All workers should have basic protections &amp; be able to build econ security for their families. #itspersonal
