Harriet Tubman has always been my hero because she was a fighter!! Fought against slavery and freed hundreds of enslaved people. 
If you want to understand Tubman's incredible journey watch "Underground" the series about the Underground Railroad on itunes. 
Harriet Tubman helped enslaved people escape---she righteously broke the law and by any means necessary to free enslaved people. 
Harriet Tubman was born in slavery, but when she died she was free woman!! 
Harriet Tubman on $20 bill and   @NMAAHC set to open---perhaps U.S. can come to grips that slavery was accepted in here for over 200 years. 
Harriet Tubman was a soldier in the Union Army---a female spy and nurse during the Civil War.
