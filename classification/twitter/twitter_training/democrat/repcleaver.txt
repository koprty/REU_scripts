This is not a game, it is the law. #CBCTech2020 
It's alarming how many companies secure gov't contracts w/o any checks/balances on diversity efforts, plans, &amp; supporting data. #CBCTech2020 
We urge @USDOL to require gov't contracted tech companies to abide by fed regulations: develop written affirmative action plans #CBCTech2020 
As of 2014, the % of African-Americans who work for tech companies whom hold sizable government contracts, was only 4.3%. #CBCTech2020 
However, minorities hired by some of the largest tech companies in Silicon Valley are virtually non-existent. #CBCTech2020 
According to @EdNCES, in 2012-2013 about 6,000 US African- American students earned computer &amp; information science degrees. #CBCTech2020 
African-Americans are majoring and graduating in computer science, they just aren‚Äôt being hired in reasonable numbers. #CBCTech2020 
We‚Äôve heard the excuse from some tech companies that there aren‚Äôt many African-American applicants, but that's not the case. #CBCTech2020 
There's been growth in other industries in African American employment, but strong underrepresentation in the tech industry #CBCTech2020 
Specifically, we're asking tech companies that hold sizable government contracts to develop written affirmative-action programs #CBCTech2020
