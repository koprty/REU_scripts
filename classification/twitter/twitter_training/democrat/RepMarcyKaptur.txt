@star153891 avg Mexican manufacturing wage was 15% of US wage pre-NAFTA; now 18%.  NAFTA did NOTHING to raise wages https://t.co/9NMIsPxYjN 
@star153891 have wages in Mexico and China gone up to a level that they can afford US-made products? #lookatthedata 
@star153891 the average tariff w/ TPP countries is 2.7%. The TPP = massive outsourcing of US manufacturing to low-wage TPP countries. 
@star153891 Trading partners must raise workers' wages, set &amp; enforce environmental &amp; labor standards. Otherwise there's no 'free' trade. 
@star153891 exactly the point. How can US firms export products to Vietnamese making $148 per month? Look @ NAFTA https://t.co/7h3ipGNRrK 
@star153891 we should all oppose bad trade deals that cost American workers hundreds of thousands of jobs. Period. #lookatthedata
