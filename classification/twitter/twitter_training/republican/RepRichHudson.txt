Like I told @RCDailyJournal I'm pursuing an investigation bc vets who were unable to adopt their MWDs deserve answrs https://t.co/KMSkt0o7rb 
I’ll continue to fight for our soldiers, veterans and military community so these heroes get the respect and care they deserve. 
Happy 39th birthday, @starwars! The force will be with you, always. https://t.co/hYG3srmsgB 
Thank you to @Rchildress3, @injuredkids &amp; our panel of experts for joining us at our #PediatricTrauma discussion! https://t.co/RtSbz8x766 
That's why I co-founded the bipartisan #PediatricTrauma Caucus with Rep. @GKButterfield to raise awareness &amp; improve policies to save lives. 
#PediatricTrauma is the #1 killer of kids &amp; higher rates of trauma are found in rural areas where it can be difficult to access timely care 
I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work to raise awareness &amp; find solutions to #savekidslives. @injuredkids https://t.co/wtJLAh6J2D 
In the US, pediatric trauma is the # 1 killer of children. That is unacceptable &amp; exactly why we’ve established the #PediatricTrauma Caucus. 
I'm excited to kick-off the #PediatricTrauma Caucus w/ @GKButterfield &amp; @Rchildress3 @injuredkids to #savekidslives! https://t.co/lwTvnpnjpb

I’ll continue to push my bill to expand access to care while empowering veterans with more choice and flexibility: https://t.co/9erqC4nbRC 
The #VA secretary’s comments are shameful. It’s critical that our #veterans get the timely, quality care they earned https://t.co/XZ9W3knv6a
