I think the most outrageous Bernie tweet I saw (not that I read a lot of them) was how it's a travesty that the there are so many millionaires in the US.  I, on the other hand, think that is a wonderful thing since most millionaires are self-made and earned it through hard work and entrepreneurship.  Sanders loves to demonize the successful as if they gained their wealth through nefarious means.  Sorry Bernie, not all of us are like the Clintons.
