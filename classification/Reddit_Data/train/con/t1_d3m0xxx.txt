My advice, which may not be very popular here, is not to subscribe to any "ism".  All it does it limits you.  Look at issues, process information, take in new information.  Some people here have a checklist of things that they seem to blindly follow.   Like small government?  You HAVE to be against abortion!  That's no better than liberals, we need to be the real intellectuals.

I used to be a Libertarian, but even those guys have some ideas I simply cannot get behind.  Just think things through, try not to fall into herd mentality/hive mind and what is right usually shines through.
