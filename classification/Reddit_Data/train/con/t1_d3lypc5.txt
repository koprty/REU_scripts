Let me disagree. 

If such a level violence happened on a campus, it would be a much different story. Just looked at what happened at Mizzou. The enrollment is down 1500 and they have a shortfall of 32 million. That violence was not shocking at all. It was only the threat of a violence by one staff member. 

In other words -- the reaction we want comes in forms of dropped enrollment, bad reviews, and fewer donations by alumni. Money makes the world go around.
