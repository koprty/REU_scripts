Good on you. It's not the easier or more popular path, but you'll view the world and society in a whole new light. Groups who self-identify as victims aren't so because another group is doing better than them. Shitting on Capitalism all the time will bring more regulation/taxation and bigger government into our lives. It's sad to see what has happened to the Democrat Party since Bill Clinton. He did so progressive things but he also did some very conservative things. Now our  "liberal" politicians ideals match those of Venezuela's former Pres. Chavez.
