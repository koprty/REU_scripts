Bernie was on a local radio show here yesterday. They totally called him out on the VA stuff. Like... 'If the gov is so great, what's up with the VA then?' His response was to instantly go into a rant about how the evil rich people and corporations are ruining everything. Same old BS. I didn't even realize he had helped run VA affairs. No wonder he doesn't like talking about it.
