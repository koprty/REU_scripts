&gt; So its not a subsidy for big oil, only the independent producers. So its a subsidy for the independent producers. 

Once again, the leftist indoctrination you have succumbed to shines through. **A tax deduction is not equal to a subsidy.** The only way to equate the two is to presume that all income earned belongs first to the government, and further assume that it would have been earned regardless of government policy (i.e. that you can tax at any rate and that businesses will not change their practices). Percentage Depletion is not a subsidy even for independent drillers. **Percentage Depletion is the oil and gas industrys version of a depreciation deduction for its main asset. Every other industry is allowed to depreciate assets.** It's a normal tax treatment commonly available to all U.S. industries. To repeal these would be special treatment of the oil industry in the negative.  

&gt; Basically I don't support any subsidies from either tax deferments or from 0 cost loans

Ignoring that you once again equate a tax deduction with a subsidy, you are saying that **you don't think any business should be able to deduct any capital expenses?** I don't know how to explain this any more simply:

* Independent oil explorers get only the exact same deductions that any other industry gets
* "Big oil" doesn't even get that. They actually have a special tax situation where they can't even take these standard types of deduction that every other industry gets. 

To make everything truly equal under the law would be to take away the actual subsidies from renewables, and expand the normal tax deductions to include "Big Oil." So please, if you really are a conservative, you desperately need an education. Educate yourself and stop simply regurgitating the left's propaganda. Your misinformation and indoctrination is embarrassing.
