I think you're really just a classical liberal. You're more for acceptance and tolerance and you don't care what people do in the bedrooms or bathrooms as long as it doesn't hurt anybody. The difference is that the liberals of today are shoving their agenda down everyone's throats and are having an arms race to prove who's the most marginalized. If you feel like you are becoming increasingly fiscally conservative, I think it's just a normal progression as you realize the inefficiency of government and how it's really up to the individual to control your own fate.
