Did you even read or comprehend the article? There is absolutely nothing any more favorable for them then any other business gets. So, in reality, you think that fossil fuel industries should have special laws that deny them standard tax advantages that all other businesses enjoy? The big ones actually do have this, but even the "independent" explorers you are denouncing are only taking capital investment write offs that any other type of business can get. You have obviously been well indoctrinated in the "evil fossil fuel" narrative of the left. And you keep using the false term "subsidy."

&gt; I just don't entertain a significant difference between cutting your tax bill by one million and flat giving you one million. 

Spoken like a true leftist. The big difference is the presumption that that money belongs to the government before it was ever earned. I don't know why you claim to be a conservative, you sound like a brainwashed leftie.
