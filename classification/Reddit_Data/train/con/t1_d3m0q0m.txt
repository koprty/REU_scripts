I agree we should protect our ecosystems but the trees used for lumbar and paper and specifically grown and not giant redwood trees. They grow trees now like we farm corn.

Again your missing the point about the animal. If the market demands it and you step in to limit or stop the supply the market still demands it and illegal trade will happen. And with no free market force to increase supply since its illegal the illegal market dominates. 

So removing endangered species would not cause us to go out and remove every type of animal and breed every animal. Only the useful ones or what the market demands. Then this is a win win since its done out in public and no some back illegal shop method, so you get better and safer results when its regulated properly.
