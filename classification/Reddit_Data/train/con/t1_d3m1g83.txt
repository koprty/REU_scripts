My liberal awakening party was June 2004 we all dressed in robes and danced around a fire to images of Jane fonda in vietnam.  You're not supposed to know that.


But seriously today I was in a starbucks and a kid told me I was a hypocrite for thinking immigrants need to come to the country legally because my ancestors were immigrants and that's what built this country.  I suggested it was a security issue not an immigrant issue and this kid blew up on me.  Mind you I said nothing of kicking people out or building a wall and I was utterly attacked for thinking people coming into the country illegally presented a possible threat.  All the while thinking of what's going on in other parts of the world where I watched this play out over the last couple years in Europe. I guess I had a moment of clarity?  Didn't understand why this kid even thought he could speak to me the way he did then I had a mother moment of clarity.  It was because this kid has been taught that way and he's never really thought for himself?  Kind of like me for the longest time.  Because it was a cool thing to be anti corporation or anti Wallstreet.  What the fuck was I thinking.  This kid had no idea how the world works and had to be at least 25. They have been influenced just like I was.  They believed playing the victim was noble?  I asked him what he did for a living.  Works at Starbucks and blogs.  At that moment I figured out I had turned into the rich conservative people I used to hate.  I have a business, I have property in southern california, I even like some country music.  In an economic sense I realized I was very conservative.  My value to society is much more now (not to boast)  so I got to thinking what other progressive liberal policies did not line up with where I was in life.  Where should men and women go to the bathroom?  Is it a black and white issue?  Then I became disgusted with the fact that this is what people find important as they blog from their mac book at a starbucks sipping their latte.  Then some further reflection.  Is it really right to force people to pay for the affordable care act if it helps fund abortions?  For me it's a grey issue (might get some heat for that here)  but for some who believe it is murder to force them to be apart of that in a circumstance where they don't even get a vote to decide on the matter.  I personally don't care if people get an abortion.  I just don't want to be forced to pay for it.  And it made sense to me.  But your taxes go to schools and you don't have kids.  Yep you're right and that's why I vote no on prop 9 every year.  You can't vot no on ACA.  Also I did taxes this year and I don't have a vagina but good thing I paid for pap smear coverage.  Oh and it was more expensive than my old insurance.  But if I go back and don't pay for ACA I'm going to get fined more than the actual cost of ACA.  No fucking joke.  I've spent a lot of time reflecting on why I voted for Obama 2 times.  It was because I was told republicans were bad and would cause another recession.  No understanding of how business or the economy worked at the time.
