Citizen of Canada here. With any emergency operations you'll get in right away. Any non emergency operations and you'll have to wait a bit (usually couple of months) and then you'll get in. We complain about wait times but the majority of Canadians wouldn't trade our system for the American system, we just want to improve on our own.
