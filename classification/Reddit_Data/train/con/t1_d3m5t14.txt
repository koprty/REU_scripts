I think that the first point is indicative of most types of liberals. Most "conservative" vs "liberal" lines are drawn by this belief. Most liberals enjoy being able to blink away the processes that often lead us to outcomes, good or bad, and like to say that we should all be able to enjoy any level of prosperity we should choose, because we are all equal.

Meanwhile the conservative thought is that we should all have an equal opportunity to make something of our lives, and that the processes we need to engage in to *get to* an outcome should be made equally available to us all.

Now, this of course doesn't really cover all of the social issues we talk about in politics now, which you have kind of laid out. I think some liberals don't even think about what I've talked about above, they don't have to blink away the processes that lead to the outcome because many of them are so used to instantaneous gratification that they think the government can just magic them some equality. And if someone produces some new issue wherein there is some perceived inequality well then BY GOD THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE US SOME EQUALITY FOR IT SOONER OR LATER!!! (see: trans bathroom rights. We are now making laws for 0.03% of the population because the govt needs to ensure we all have equality of outcome!)
