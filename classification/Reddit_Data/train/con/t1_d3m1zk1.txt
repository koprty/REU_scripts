I haven't been to the doctor in a couple years. I just can't afford the medical bills. Shit happens like I had an infection in my finger, I just googled a home remedy for it and it went away.


I mean this isn't ideal. Ideally I'd be able to see a doctor and get medicine, but I just roll the dice and hope for the best.
