You are pigeon-holing a person you never met into a mold that you created. A mold based on limited knowledge of this person's experiences. It doesn't matter if he was a murderer, rapist, child molester, wife-beater, whatever. Praising the death of a person is fucked up. All of those people on national TV cheering after hearing Bin Laden died? They're all fucked up too.
