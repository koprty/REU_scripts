We did precisely that in 2006.  He won as an Independent, so he wasn't up for reelection until 2012 when he decided to retire.  Since we needed his 60tg vote to break the filibuster (not to mention the votes of McCaskill, Nelson, and other Blue Dogs), we could either get some improvements made or do nothing.  Given that we lost the 60 seat supermajority, and have since lost the Senate entirely, it seems clear to me that the right decision was to pass what we could with the votes we had rather than wait another 50 years.

That you're not familiar with the tremendous legislative hurdles faced by the ACA and that you think the solution to dealing with recalcitrant Senators is just primary them betrays tremendous ignorance and naivete.  You need to understand how things work before simply declaring everyone who disagrees with you to be stupid and corrupt and telling as all how your way is so much smarter.
