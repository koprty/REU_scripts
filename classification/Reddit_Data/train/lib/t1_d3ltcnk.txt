I'm busy today - so you lazy republicans will have to look it up on the internet.  

I just googled 'Trump racism' and got this: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_us_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83

But you won't read it, your Sarah Palin mind is already made up... and that's also why I'm not gonna waste my time.
