A disclosure is voluntary and has a bit of a "Fudge Factor"

Applying for a loan? Lets pump up the value of assets at the upper end of the market and forget to add a couple of lines of debt.

Applying for bankruptcy? Lets claim the property was undervalued at purchase and list every expense we can think of.

Tax has actual law you have to follow and he pays big money to an accountant to make sure he doesnt have to pay any more tax than he has to. They all do. 

His tax form *could* divulge how much he gives (or not) to which charities. How much he hides in offshore accounts. How much he devalues properties he has pumped up in value for a sale. But mainly his actual tax rate. Which, if its less than lets say his secretary, his political foes could use against him.
