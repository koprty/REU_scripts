She has actually kept most of the "down ballot"money like from the Hillary Victory Super-PAC. Bernie's fundraising has slowed a lot but it is almost equal to Hillarys and he is likely to loose. That is impressive. Voting for someone who will just enforce the system is that screwing us will only enforce that system. A vote for Hillary is a vote for the status quo. She will do nothing to fix campaign finance
