No seriously, tell me you aren't that blind. You really think rich donors and people from Wall Street, people known for getting return on investment(seeing how they're rich) are just giving her millions of dollars for their health, expecting nothing in return? Come on, I know you're not that stupid. People like that just don't waste money, let alone hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.
