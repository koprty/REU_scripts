I have a problem with this line of thinking:

Don't boycott because you will hurt innocent people and the powerful don't care anyway.

Don't protest because it doesn't accomplish anything and the powerful don't care anyway.

Don't vote because all politicians are the same/corrupt and the powerful don't care anyway.

All that's left is get in line and take what you're given.  I'm all for not wasting effort, but that's not excuse to not make an effort.
