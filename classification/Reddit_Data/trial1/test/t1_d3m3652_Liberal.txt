&gt; but that doesnt count caucuses

What do you mean?

Caucuses hardly help a pro-Bernie argument.  They're much lower turnout than primaries, and are massively biased toward people with both enthusiasm and spare time to attend.  Even non-binding primaries in caucus states have much higher turnout than caucuses, and Hillary has won at least the WA and NE primaries.
