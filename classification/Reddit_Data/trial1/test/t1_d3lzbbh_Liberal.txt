A boycott because my CEO ran for office would be out of line.

A boycott because my CEO was a demagogue who is actively damaging the national conversation on a variety of subjects and fulminating fear, uncertainty and doubt is a horse of a different color.

Even if I thought a boycott is out of line, I think that I would recognize both sides of a boycott should be argued on its merits, not on a basis that invalidates one of the mainstays of public engagement in civil society.

Also, I reject the contention that a boycott doesn't punish Trump.  Even if he doesn't miss a meal, he's made it clear over many years he always cares about making more money.
