He won with something like 40% of the vote. Did you not remember numerous Republican party establishment figures publicly denouncing him for not being a conservative? Have you already forgot that only a few years ago he was a registered Democrat and fund raised for the Clintons?

Just Google "Trump is not a conservative" and see the long list of preeminent conservative publications and noted conservative opinion leaders saying the same. Go on /r/conservative and /r/Libertarian and see the hate that Trump gets there. 

Face it. A goose-stepping fascist hijacked the Republican party based on a weak field and a wave of anti establishment discontent. Enjoy the ride.
