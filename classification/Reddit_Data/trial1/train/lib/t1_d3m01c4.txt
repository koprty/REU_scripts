I'm not arguing a boycott should be undertaken lightly.  Far from it.

The fact that divestment from South Africa undoubtedly hurt individuals against apartheid, doesn't mean divestment of SA was the wrong choice.

The fact that the Montgomery bus boycott undoubtedly hurt individuals against segregation doesn't mean the bus boycott was wrong either.

The body politic reaches for this course of action when other means of being heard do not prove effective.  It seems like the other means of being heard have been diminished in effectiveness over the decades, so this is what is reached for now.  Boycott *is* civil, in fact it is the last civil protest available before uncivil protest (i.e. riots).

I'm not even arguing we should boycott Trump.  There seems to be a good argument for it, but I haven't fully considered it because I'm not in a position to participate.  What I object to is the blanket argument against all boycotts on the grounds of unintended consequences.
