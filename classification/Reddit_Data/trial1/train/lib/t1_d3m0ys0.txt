Oki doki, sounds good then, I'll just vote for the 'Woman of the People' that can't release her speech to Goldman.  I didn't realize 'Liberal' had to be synonymous with 'unable to admit that one of ours is a fucking liar and only out to benefit herself', or 'we all hate on Cosby, but her track record of covering up her husbands long history of sexual assault is totally different'.
