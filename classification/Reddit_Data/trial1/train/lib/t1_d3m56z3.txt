Nihilism:

-the rejection of all religious and moral principles, often in the belief that life is meaningless

How is that nihilism again? And no not the entire establishment. Liz Warren for instant is not. But let me ask you, if we as liberals think that super Pacs corrupt, why do we think the DNC is immune to this corruption? Why is the GOP not? It's silly, super Pacs corrupt across the board, including the DNC establishment
