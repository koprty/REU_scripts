The ability to read and write is necessary in almost every line of work. It would be unfair to give someone less of an opportunity for something like a paralegal job because they can't read and write, but it wouldn't be discrimination to dismiss their application on those grounds. Even at your place of employment you must have to be able to read manifest notes, create shipping labels, and follow written procedure. The same goes for not giving someone confined to a wheelchair a job in cell phone tower maintenance. imo it's not discriminatory to not give someone a job that they're not able to complete in a satisfactory manner, even if they can't help their performance.

Any issues with society's views on the physically and mentally disabled are an entirely different animal. It can be difficult to get a representative elected on a platform of disabled people's right because they will face the same social stigma that disabled people face themselves.
