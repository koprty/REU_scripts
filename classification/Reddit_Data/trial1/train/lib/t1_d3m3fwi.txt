I'm gratified you're also not against all boycotts.  Your earlier argument seems indite all boycotts, and is a sentiment I want to push back against. 

Couched in the terms you use here, opposition to this boycott is less objectionable, to me at least.  I'm still ambivalent about this boycott.  I understand why the targets of his demagoguery feel sufficient cause.
