&gt; Real progressives, who care about the issues

Certainly you aren't talking about Hillary supporters. If they were real progressives who cared about issues, they wouldn't be supporting a candidate that doesn't want a tax on carbon, who is awash in citizen's united money, a Wall Street darling and wants to expand the oil and gas industry.

Also, you didn't describe me at all.
