That seems to be a true statement actually.

Remember America has had 7+ years of republican obstruction, doing nothing, shutting down the government, racism, and pandering to lobbyists... etc. Not even one forward-thinking, independent thought from republicans... and worse, you picked Trump - the biggest bigot, misogynist, who is even dumber than Sarah Palin.
