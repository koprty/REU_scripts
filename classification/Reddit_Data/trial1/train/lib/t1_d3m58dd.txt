You know what people from Wall Street want more than anything else?  Economic stability.  They'd rather spend on Clinton because they know Trump would be a disaster.  They want an environment where they feel their investments are safe so that they're able to speculate.  Most don't actually care about the ability to spend directly on elections.  The ones that do are either the Dominionists or the Libertarians.  So, when Clinton says she will appoint Justices who will overturn CU, I don't think her Wall Street connections will prevent her from doing so since the ones who benefit most from it tend to be lined up on the other side anyway.
