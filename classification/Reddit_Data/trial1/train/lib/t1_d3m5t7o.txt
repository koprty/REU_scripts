It's politically nihilistic.  And if you can only find two Senators out of 46 who you consider to be sufficiently pure, then we've got a big problem.

SuperPACs are dangerous because they can be used in a corrupt way, but a SuperPAC isn't corruption by its very nature.  The Nurses union SuperPAC which has supported Sanders certainly isn't corrupt.  The real risk is individual billionaires with extreme views who use the cloak of a SuperPAC to spend to advance their views.  People like the Koch brothers, Foster Friess, Sheldon Adelson, the Waltons, and the owners of Hobby Lobby are the ones who can wreak real havoc.  I believe we should have serious limits on corporate spending in elections, and that means eliminating SuperPACs which can be easily abused, but this doesn't mean that people who use SuperPACs in non abusive says are automatically corrupt.
