All people like her care about is hating Republicans/Conservatives. You can hear it in her voice. She is filled with hate. They don't give a shit about facts or reality. If a Republican/Conservative is for something, they will be against it. If a Republican/Conservative is against something, they will be for it. They can't help themselves. They can never bring themselves to agree to a single word any Republican/Conservative says, ever. I dislike Obama, but even I can say that I thought going after OBL the way he did, took some balls. I just wish he did more stuff like that. People like her on the other hand, would rather die than ever admit a Republican/Conservative person ever had a single good idea about anything.
