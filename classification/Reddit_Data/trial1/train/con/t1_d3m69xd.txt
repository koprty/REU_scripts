I've heard it's not so bad in most of Canada but it's *really* bad in Quebec. (Wait times are all day events sometimes)

And I think it's easy for Canadians to enjoy it because it's taxed out of their paychecks. If you're a average family of 2 parents 1 child in Canada, it's about $11,000 a year. Which means probably a little over $400 is coming out of your paycheck to pay for "free health care". I bet Canadians wouldn't love it so much if each month they had to write a check to their government for about $900.
