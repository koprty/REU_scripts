The way the world is designed, there's always going to be inequality of outcomes. There's no two ways about it. I think of the conservative perspective is putting the effort to make the playing field as level as possible *without* artificial handicaps. I think the liberal perspective is making the outcome equal regardless of the input a person puts in. Conservatives blame themselves when they don't succeed; liberals blames everyone but themselves.

But I also think it can't totally be reduced to this. I just have a hard time of understanding the liberal mindset at all.
