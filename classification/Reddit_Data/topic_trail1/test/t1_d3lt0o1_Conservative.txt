Disney brings in so such more cash and jobs from the rest of the world into the US that it is not even funny. Under in particular this has just gone up, up, and up. Start Wars, Marvel, Pixar. Heck little girls in India are making their parents pay money to Disney in the US so that their lunch boxes can have the Frozen Princesses on them.

Bob Iger did that by focusing on entertainment from top to bottom. IT is not Disney's core business. It does not give Disney an edge, it does not have an particular expertise on it -- it is a distraction, so he outsourced it. The tech parts that gives disney an edge? Things like computer animation -- they are staying in house.
