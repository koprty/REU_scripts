...what? That is actually really cheap, particularly for employers who no longer need to contribute to an employees health plan.  I commented on this elsewhere, but i'll paste it here for you.

To give a comparison, I work at a university and for an employee with 2 dependents a monthly payment is about $160 a month, and the employer contributes about $680 a month for an HMO(about $10,080 a year for insurance) and an OAP is $180(you)+$810(employer)=11880 a year. But you also need to take into account that these plans still have things like co-pays and deductibles before they kick-in.  I am in an HMO and my copay is 20 for a walk-in and 25 for a specialist.
