The thing that gets me, though, is how they focus on how the CEO earns so much more, as if he's just not allowed to earn more money than others, or even worse, as if the living conditions of all of those workers wouldn't matter anymore if the CEO took a pay cut.  That it's not a matter of quality of life, but only inequality stemming from the fact that someone making decisions that generate or lose millions of dollars is rewarded appropriately for success, but since there can only be one person in such a position, it's unfair to have him be paid more than anyone else.

I'd have a lot more respect for their stance, even if I still didn't agree with it, if they didn't portray it as a matter of inequality and actually focused on what they claim to profess.
