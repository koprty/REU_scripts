I think you misunderstand the meaning of "might makes right" or perhaps I misunderstood your meaning? There is a huge difference between might makes right and violence can be justified for the right cause. 


There are several different definitions and meanings to that aphorism/idiom, but mostly commonly, Might makes right is used as a theory to say that because you are more powerful your thoughts, beliefs, or justice are more valid. This is not true and leads to tyranny of the "mighty" over the meek, 

Might does not make a cause more just, a cause, the fundamentals of Americanism, are "right" because they empower the individual and limit the tyranny of the majority over the minority. This is an extremely important concept and runs directly counter to the "might makes right" school of thought. If might makes right than those with more power (more Might) would be justified in their rule over the less mighty, if they founders believed in might makes right they would have gladly served one of the most mighty and powerful empires in history, instead, because of their convictions, their beliefs, they rebelled. They rebelled and succeeded not because they were more mighty, but because their thoughts and beliefs were more just. 

Self governance, the right to bear arms are rights afforded to all citizens, young and old, rich and poor, the weak and the strong. 

The declaration of independence makes this quiet clear; "We hold these truths to be self-evident, **that all men are created equal**" not just the mighty.
