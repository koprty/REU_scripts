Trump Campaign Admits His Call for a Wall is Just a Suggestion

One Times columnist who was present for infamous off-the-record meeting, Gail Collins, wrote this of Trump's campaign rhetoric:

&gt; The most optimistic analysis of Trump as a presidential candidate is that he just doesnt believe in positions, except the ones you adopt for strategic purposes when youre making a deal. So you obviously cant explain how youre going to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, because its going to be the first bid in some future monster negotiation session.
