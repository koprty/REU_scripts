Two problems i see with this.

1. What happens to that debt?  The hospital had to use resources to treat you, so that must have cost them something.

2. If they don't have debt forgiveness you are basically taking out a 0% loan to pay for a hospital bill. 

Overall, i just feel that the cost of healthcare is more costly to citizens than if we just had some sort of single payer system.  Maybe do it state by state to keep costs in line with average state salaries.
