Reddit is a poor representation of really any group of people unfortunately, but the Berniebots on Reddit have been pretty fucking racist. I mean, just look at their threads on nights they've lost elections, especially in SE states with heavy amounts of minorities.

Straight up posts saying vile things about minorities not recognizing the glorious red sun of Bernie.
