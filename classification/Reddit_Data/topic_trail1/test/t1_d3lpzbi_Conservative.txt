I'm going to paraphrase an analysis I read about Newt as VP. If Trump picks a woman VP, it won't really help him with women voters. Same goes with picking a minority in attempt to sway more minority votes. So it would behoove him to select someone to help push his agenda through congress. Newt has proven that he is fully capable of working with both parties to push items through the House and Senate. Secondly, Newt would help in securing the Republican base come November.
