Right but we live our life on assumptions. If we started trying to live based on every possible outcome of every situation we wouldn't get very far. I don't think it's inaccurate to say:

&gt;quite possibly be even worse

if there is a fair amount of evidence pointing that direction. I definitely think picking a probable outcome is better than saying "eh, can't know"
