IMO, Trump has made way too many mistakes to be masterful.

Remember when Trump said that women who seek abortions should be subject to some form of punishment?

Eventually, [after several attempts,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/) he found a conservative stance.

I'd like to see Trump give more conservative answers on the very first try.

So when Trump says the right thing, I'll give him credit for saying the right thing.

Believing him is a different issue.

Next he should say that he will undo decades of accumulated EPA regulations which are choking U.S. businesses.
