Socialism is coercion. Socialism is forcing the mass of people to conform to the collective. Socialism is command economies, command labor, command compliance with every dictate and order from the government. Socialism allows no one left alone to do anything individual.

Sanders has a well-earned reputation as an ol' Bolshevik bastard. In the name of his outdated ideology, Sanders has unabashedly supported some squalid dictators in their tyrannical efforts to corral, control and politically correct all the people. He has never renounced his past transgressions against the American way nor publicly expressed regret for supporting murderous governments. Given the pornographic ugliness of Sanders' politics, no one should feel shocked a stodgy Stalinist socialist sociopath should also prove a mean, nasty, annoying little man.
