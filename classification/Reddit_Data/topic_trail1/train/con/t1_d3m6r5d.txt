Does this seem to drive his platform of increasing benefits nationwide e.g. that would include more for VA-eligible?

I can't tell what strong free-market advocates want for improving VA benefits.  I assume it involves moving the VA into a private org, but then I think that means war will cost more, so that the 'employees of war' earn more for their labor, which complements the cost of the lifestyle needs that makes for a suitable supply of war-job workers.

From my experience of military families, there is a non-free-market pressure on maintaining the supply of 'war-workers' despite the benefits otherwise balancing the low-value of the demand.
