&gt; Since the world is broken and we need government, therefore might must make right.

He was arguing against this concept in his speech, but I disagree with him.  Might absolutely makes right.  There may, under some rock in a forgotten corner, be natural rights that are clearly self-evident to all and untouchable, but in the world the rest of us live in, rights must be backed up by the threat of violence.  The Founders did not sit back and assume that the British would recognize their claims to self-government and the right to bear arms.  They fought a brutal and long civil war to guarantee those rights, and then backed them up with both the Constitution (governmental violence) and the 2nd Amendment (civilian violence).  We forget this fact at our peril.
