In my opinion, our goal as citizens shouldn't be to aim to have our congress sit on their ass and do nothing but fight. It doesn't often get reported by the media but there's a lot of reasonable legislation that isn't necessarily economic/social (wedge issue) related that ends up getting delayed or not moved to the floor at all because of gridlock. The whole amendment process really compounds this.
