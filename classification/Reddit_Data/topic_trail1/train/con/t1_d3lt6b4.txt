Those involved with the government effectively become the new "bourgeoisie." A society where everyone is at an equal stature simply cannot be enforced without a central authoritative body to keep everyone in check due to the human nature of always wanting more. The problem is that same human nature causes the authoritative body to become drunk on its own power over others. 

It's self-defeating. Humans are fallible creatures and an incorruptible, "perfect" system will never be allowed to exist.
