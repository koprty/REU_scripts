This is oddly exciting.

I looks like Trump is making a play for the labor unions.

If he can get the SEIU, and teachers, and carpenters, and electricians, etc.

the Democratic party could be marginalized forever.

Of course the "Trump-Republican" party would be de facto Progressive,

leaving plenty of room on the right for a new Conservative party.
