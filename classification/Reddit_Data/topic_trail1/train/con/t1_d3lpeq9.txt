I've never given it too much thought.  I think you're probably right for many of them in that their views are formed more by ignorance than something concrete.  I also think many of the younger liberals fear or, for some reason, despise "the system".  "The System" being our western society's constructs, such as the US Constitution and free market capitalism, probably appear to be controlling their life.  Our society effectively assumes you will become a relatively responsible and productive citizen.  Perhaps some people simply can't accept that.  What they can't see is that the alternatives that they champion would bring about an oppressive and authoritative system.
