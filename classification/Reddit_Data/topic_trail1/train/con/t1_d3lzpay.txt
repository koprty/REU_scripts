Don't worry too much about labels, at a certain point they no longer become helpful. I find myself in a similar boat as you however. I consider myself a "small-L" liberal. The word itself now carries a lot of baggage that I don't really associate with my beliefs. I don't think my own politics have changed so much as "liberals" have swept the rug out from under me and usurped the term. Perhaps like RINOs of the left.
