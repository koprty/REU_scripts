You are incapable of referring to these groups you don't like in any way that is not derogatory, aren't you.  Homosexuals are "sodomites" (despite the fact that that word can equally apply to the vast majority of heterosexuals) and transgendered are "trannies". I like how you keep the language just tame enough so as not to be too offensive to most while still managing to clearly convey your contempt.
