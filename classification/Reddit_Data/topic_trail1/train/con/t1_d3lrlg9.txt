&gt; Why is this article being down voted?

Because the article is based on $13,000 in taxes that are in dispute. Companies deal with this all the time, my own company that I work for has to deal with audits and disputes all the time. Not because we try to avoid taxes, but because it's easy to mess up numbers here and there. This is not news to anyone, but because the head of this particular company is running for president it makes the news.
