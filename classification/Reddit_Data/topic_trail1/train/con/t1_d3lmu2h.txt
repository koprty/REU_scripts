A modern day problem? Pray tell after the hijra, did Muhammed send out raiding parties against the Meccans??

Islam is largely a religion of its roots and its roots lead directly to a culture that glorified violence, inter-tribal raidings, lex talonis e.t.c.

Jainism is a religion of peace, hell Christianity is a religion of peace, Judaism and Islam are not. They were forged in hard environments and reflect that.
