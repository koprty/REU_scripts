&gt; Obama isn't interfering in Eastern Europe.

He is. If anyone is interfering in the politics of Eastern Europe, it is Russia. It is Russia's backyard. What was the US reaction when USSR pushed heavily into the US backyard in Cuba?For the same reasons, the Russians protect it as much as the US does its own backyard.

&gt; We aren't friends with Pakistan, but we need them in the fight against the Taliban/stabilizing Afghanistan. This has been the calculus since 9/11 under the Bush Administration

Pakistan played Bush for a fool .. something he quickly realized, particularly after Tora Bora. But check out how the AID shot up after 2008.

&gt; The US is still slated to spend 1 Trillion dollars modernizing its nuclear weapons over decades. Which means other countries with the bomb will do so to. 

&gt; And this is a bad thing?

By itself it is not. But it makes the impassioned rhetoric about global nuclear disarmament look completely ridiculous. Its like making a speech for vegetarianism while cooking a steak over a grill and saying that looks yummy.
