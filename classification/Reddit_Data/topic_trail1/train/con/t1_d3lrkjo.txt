Kind of seems biased to me. I'm a liberal and I agree that many liberals blame others, but I always see comments on Fox News Facebook posts blaming Obama, Muslims, Mexicans, atheists, for many problems. As someone who tends to be on the center left on many issues I think Botha sides are at fault for similar thinking
