Psychology uses the scientific method like any other science. Yes psychology is more subjective, but that is why the scientific method is so important to execute properly in their research. If you're thinking psychology has nothing to do with genetics, biology and the chemistry/makeup of ones brain is where you're wrong. 

I don't understand why people like you put your opinion over empirical evidence. Why do we have a multimillion dollar drug industry surrounding psychological diseases if it was founded on "pseudoscience"? You're entitled to think whatever you want, but don't try and claim you understand what is factual and not if you're confused about the definition the scientific method.
