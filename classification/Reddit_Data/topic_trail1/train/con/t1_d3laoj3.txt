You're absolutely allowed to disagree.  You're also allowed to espouse views and beliefs that run counter to American tradition.  Bernie Sanders has made a career in pushing policies that totally go against what the American experiment is all about.  I'm just saying, I wish all you progressives would stop trying to remake America and go move somewhere that already matches your Euro-sensibilities.
