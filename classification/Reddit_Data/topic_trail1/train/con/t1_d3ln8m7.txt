"You know, there was a time in this country when smart people were considered cool... well maybe not cool, but they did things like build ships and pyramids and they even went to the moon." Pvt. Joe Bauers, Idiocracy.

At first glance, this squalid public display appears an uncalculated act by clueless clowns chocking on cheap cynicism. This is precisely the sort of thing that can't help reinforce the commonly held notion that college kids today are deliberately kept ignorant. This learned ignorance is based on the academic certainty that such an unenlightened state will eventually flower into adult onset stupidity know domestically as "a lifelong Democrat." If a good brainwashing is required to get people to vote correctly, then that's what they'll get for the big money spent unwisely on a college degree in dissolution.

People concerned the country is destined for imminent idiocracy are hopelessly correct. What passes for knowledge today no rational adult can hope to understand. These days, stupid people are no longer content being stupid. Nowadays, the public idiot is out proud and loud, an angry advocate for global dissipation and entitled indolence.
