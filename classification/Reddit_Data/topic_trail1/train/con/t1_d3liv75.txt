These special snowflake sjw feminazis won't survive a day or two in the corporate world when they graduate--assuming they could even find a job with their bullshit degrees. A libertarian friend of mine told me how his family business rejects 19 out of 20 applicants and that's just for waitstaff positions. Whining about every perceived social injustice and focusing on making yourself feel better rather than doing the job you're assigned will not get you anywhere.

What's next, these regressive leftists will sue businesses for getting triggered when they get turned down? Demand safe spaces in workplaces?
