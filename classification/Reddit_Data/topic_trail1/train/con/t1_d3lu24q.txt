&gt;Are START III negotiations back on? No. Obama's interfering in the politics of states that were not just in Russia, but were literally part of the former USSR, guarantees this is not going to happen soon.

Obama isn't interfering in Eastern Europe. If anyone is interfering in the politics of Eastern Europe, it is Russia. These are sovereign countries that have the right to have any type of relationship they want with U.S./NATO. That they are so fearful of Russia is more indicative of Russian actions than the U.S. Plus, this engagement with Eastern European, former Soviet Union states began under President Clinton and accelerated under President Bush. The only failing that Obama had was that he attempted to reset the relationship with Russia.

&gt;Rogue nuclear powers get rewarded. For example: Pakistan supplied nuclear know-how to North Korea and continues to get a ton of aid.

We aren't friends with Pakistan, but we need them in the fight against the Taliban/stabilizing Afghanistan. This has been the calculus since 9/11 under the Bush Administration.

&gt;The US is still slated to spend 1 Trillion dollars modernizing its nuclear weapons over decades. Which means other countries with the bomb will do so to.

And this is a bad thing? You accuse President Obama of apologizing, but he didn't do that. He just did what politicians do everyday make general statements and platitudes. He and the U.S. are being realistic, we'll need nuclear weapons. And while it would be nice not to have them, that isn't the world we live in.
