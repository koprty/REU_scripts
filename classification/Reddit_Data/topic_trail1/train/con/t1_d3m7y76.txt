&gt;  2 parents 1 child in Canada, it's about $11,000 a year

So just a heads up, that is actually not that bad.  To give a comparison, I work at a university and for an employee with 2 dependents a monthly payment is about $160 a month, and the employer contributes about $680 a month for an HMO(about $10,080 a year for insurance) and an OAP is $180(you)+$810(employer)=11880 a year.  But you also need to take into account that these plans still have things like co-pays and deductables before they kick-in
