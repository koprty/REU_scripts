This is just another example of Obama's lust for a photo-op for an opportunity to Look Presidential^TM . It also dovetails nicely with his apology tour. Does it have any implications beyond that? Heck no.

*  Are START III negotiations back on? No. Obama's interfering in the politics of states that were not just in Russia, but were literally part of the former USSR, guarantees this is not going to happen soon 

* Do smaller states have less of an incentive to get weapons under Obama? No - We all saw what happened to Libya under Obama, after they previously cut a deal with the US under Bush to stop their nuclear program

* Rogue nuclear powers get rewarded. For example: Pakistan supplied nuclear know-how to North Korea and continues to get a ton of aid,

* The US is still slated to spend 1 Trillion dollars modernizing its nuclear weapons over decades. Which means other countries with the bomb will do so to. 

Basically it is Obama saying "Look at me! I'm so brave to apologize for ending WW2. And I'm so smart to do so without actually saying sorry. Praise me mainstream media, praise me."
