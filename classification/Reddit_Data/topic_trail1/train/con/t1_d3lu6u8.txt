As a huge Marco fan, this is the only really viable move he could make. Not a full endorsement persay, but he's honoring his pledge he made and he's making a stand against Hillary. Rubio for most of his campaign ran a very anti Hillary campaign. Anti-Trump only was for a few weeks really. He's honoring the bulk of his campaign by moving against her. 

If we're gonna have Trump as president, might as well have a guy like Rubio as his VP.
