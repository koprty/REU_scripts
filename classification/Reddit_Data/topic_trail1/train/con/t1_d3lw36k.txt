Liberalism isn't doing anything now that it hasn't been doing for the past 50 years, appealing to and influencing young people who don't necessarily have an understanding of how the world really operates but do have the energy and enthusiasm to demand and enact the social changes that liberalism would like to see happen. 

Maybe you're just growing older and wiser and have moved past the phase in your life where you're so easily influenced and are starting to see the recklessness of such wild demand for change. That's what happened to me
