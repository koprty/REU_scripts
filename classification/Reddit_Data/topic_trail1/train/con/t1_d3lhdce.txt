The eviction process and density limits are costly. In California hotel evictions can be done on the first day of delinquency by merely locking the guest out, whereas apartments can take up to 3 months and require court orders and fees of up to $2000. Density limits mean that on a given plot of land you could put 300 hotel units or less then half that number of apartments and is probably the largest driver of increased cost.
