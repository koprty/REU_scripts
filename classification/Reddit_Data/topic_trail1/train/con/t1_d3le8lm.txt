&gt; It is actually illegal for them to do anything other than maximize their profits - that is their fiduciary duty to their shareholders.

I see this tossed around a lot.  It's a stupid falsity.  When something is illegal it means that it is a crime.  Do you really think that a state or the federal government enacted a law that says that a corporation has to pay its workers as little as possible?

Do you think that small government conservatives should be supporting the idea that the government can tell business owners how much to pay their workers?

This lie that companies are required to short-sightedly maximize their profits comes, usually at least, from a case, [Dodge v. Ford Motor Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.).  What should be as often cited is the [Business Judgment Rule] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_judgment_rule), which says that corporate officers may run their corporations as they see fit as long as there is some rational link between their actions and shareholder value.

The Dodge case was in 1919.  There is a [case from 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlensky_v._Wrigley), where the owner of Wrigley stadium didn't want to install lights to allow for night games.  He thought it ruined the pastoral enjoyment of baseball.  Shareholders sued because all the other baseball parks were raking in cash from night games.  According to your "maximizing profits" rule, how do you think the case should have been decided?

What do you think the actual ruling was?
