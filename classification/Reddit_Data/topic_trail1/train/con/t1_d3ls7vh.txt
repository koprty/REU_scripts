&gt;Then the only reason those kids would be born is that their mother couldn't abort them. What kind of a mother would she be to that kid? Combine this with banning contraception and sex education and you're gonna get dumpsters full of babies and orphanages full of kids. Some lives are not worth living in my opinion.

You don't have the moral authority to make that call. None of us can play God like that. No life is predetermined to suck, and frankly, some lives being lived in underdeveloped nations right now are a lot happier than American lives. It's all a matter of perspective.

IMO, where the pro-choice movement runs into hypocrisy is that they say they don't want to see lives born without a sporting chance, but they don't commit themselves to teaching sexual responsibility. They say they do (sex education and all that), but they'd never teach abstinence. No religious angle here - it's the most effective route of avoiding unwanted pregnancies, hands-down, and if people were really committed to avoiding unwanted pregnancies, they'd take that route. It's most effective AND it dodges any moral dilemma handily. But no - gotta have our sex. Heaven forbid we should treat the most powerful faculty we have as human beings with some respect.
