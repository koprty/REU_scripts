I agree with you that some research design is flawed, but you can't dismiss the whole psychological domain as garbage. There's a lot of good research out there. You're starting to lose your argument. You initially stated that psychology did not follow the scientific method, and now you're claiming it does follow the scientific method but you're changing your argument to a criticism of the evidence. You do realize the diversity in psychological studies right? Evidence can be based on chemical levels, brain abnormalities, and real quantifiable information. I'm guessing you're criticizing subjective surveys and observational studies which you're right to do because everyone in the scientific community does. If we both agree on what you claim to be quantifiable evidence, then you cannot dismiss psychology on mental illnesses just like gender dysphoria because there are proven brain and hormonal anomalies present in these individuals.
