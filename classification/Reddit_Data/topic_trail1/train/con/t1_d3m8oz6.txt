Or, you could eliminate all of the things nourishing all those rats. 

Stop putting an all-you-can-eat buffet out unattended every morning. Get rid of all the garbage. Clean everything top to bottom. Set traps that lure rats away from where they live. Get a couple cats and a pellet gun. 

Yeah, it'll take a bit longer, but I don't have to burn down my house in the process.
