You keep writing as though the fact that foster children aren't magically and instantly adopted proves that unborn infants doomed to be aborted would be unwanted by adoptive parents. You continue to ignore the fact that most of the children in foster care are NOT ELIGIBLE for adoption and will never be. In only 25% of cases is adoption the goal, in most cases the goal is reunification.

There are of course tragic gaps. There ARE "unwanted children" in the system that have difficulty being placed for adoption because most potential adoptive parents do not want older children with the baggage these children unfortunately have or infants with severe health issues caused by substance abuse.

I think you're also ignoring the emotional wrecking ball adopting a foster child can involve that is not present when the parent of an "unwanted" child willingly puts them up for adoption. Most foster children that are adopted are adopted by their foster parents. That can be a long and agonizing process for them as unwilling birth parents and the courts can drag the process on for years... and sometimes that birth parent they've long ago written off as a lost cause turns themselves around and wins their child back. A wonderful and positive thing but painful for a foster parent that thought they were well down the road to adopting a child they love.
