I dunno. I own a house, I got a very good price, and at the end of the day I'm paying maybe just a little less than what I could if I rented. 

&gt; amenities 

Maybe this. If it was my house but no kitchen it might rent for cheaper. 

Though, there are a lot of apartments with no kitchen in NJ. they rent for ~$400 dollars cheaper than the ones with kitchens.
