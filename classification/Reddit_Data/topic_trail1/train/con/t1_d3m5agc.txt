Welcome to /r/conservative. Feel free to stick around and check out our ideas. I think a lot of them have merit and are worth considering. Just like with the liberals, we have some weirdos and some bad apples, but conservatism as a whole seems to be gaining momentum again and moving in a great direction. 

And just so you know, what most people call "liberalism" hasn't been part of the Democrat party since the 1950's or so. Most people haven't had a meaningful discussion of politics with a liberal, so they haven't noticed. They hear some of the talking points, and liberal talking points tend to sound great. The nuts and bolts of their policies just tend to not match up well with American values or, frankly, reality. "Liberal" these days means liberal taxes, liberal spending, liberal regulations, and liberal exceptions to your Constitutionally protected rights. There's not much liberty left in their platform.
