The funniest part is how many Bernie supporters followed his lead about the "damn e-mails" and haven't brought them back up...until now. Fake Black Guy Shaun King is so DISGUSTED with the e-mail story. He said he spent the past 24 hours studying the report despite it not being out that long at the time of said tweet. 

Seriously. At the time, reports were already coming out about the e-mails and how she was lying. Only now, when they're desperate, do they choose to realize she was lying. Hilarious.
