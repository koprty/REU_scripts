That's a fair argument I suppose, but I do feel like it doesn't give an equally fair critique to Christianity. Granted, Christianity is nowhere near a violent religion by dogma as Islam is, but it's not blameless either. I feel like many of its tenets are explained away by scholarly interpretation, much like the "good" Muslims do to their tenets.
