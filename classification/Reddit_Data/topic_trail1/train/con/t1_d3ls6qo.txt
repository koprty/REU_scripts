You should watch a rally or maybe listen to his energy speech... or his speech at the NRA convention... or the stuff he has been saying about the supreme court judges.  He is loyal to the people who have voted him to where he is now and it is quite evident in the stances and policies he is making.  At this point your complaints about him being a "democrat" or "leftist" just sound pretty pathetic.
