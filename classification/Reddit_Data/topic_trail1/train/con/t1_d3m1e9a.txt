I'm the guy who still supports the same policies and world views that I did 20 years ago. I'm not the one complaining about how much the GOP sucks and how much Bush sucks... thats the Trump brigade.

I don't give a shit about respectability, son. The word you are looking for is "Consistency" or perhaps "Personal Responsibility".

But I can understand how these may be foreign concepts for you. You can return to your daily consumption of "HUBBA HUBBA HUBBA, MONEY MONEY MONEY - WHO DO YOU TRUST?"... Hope that all works out for you.

Please make sure to wear your Trump hat or bumpersticker or T-shirt daily! Don't want to mistake you for anything else, gnome sane?
