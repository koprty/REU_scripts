&gt; The declaration of independence makes this quiet clear; "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal" not just the mighty. 

Yes, it made it clear, but it didn't make it anything more than flowery words.  The long grind of the Revolution and eventual victory made it reality, thanks in large part to both French intervention and the logistical nightmare that Britain faced when operating across the Atlantic.  The just-ness of the Founders' beliefs had nothing to do with it.  

Ideals are just that - ideal.  They do not triumph because we wish it.  There is no 'right side of history', as Obama believes.  There is only the side of the winners.  We believe what we believe because our ancestors, at some point, won a battle or a war over it. 

Believing otherwise is a comfortable illusion afforded us here in the West.  Study history, or travel to the Middle East or to Africa, and you will see a different mindset.
