First of all, her duckface is FUCKIN ANNOYING. I don't fucking care about the person's race or religion, I just get irritated whenever people make that stupid selfie post. Now for the more rational part, it is the lefwing-controlled media that wants to play the "hating-Islamic-terrorists-means-hating-all-Muslims" card and keep the masses away from the real threat of global Islamic terrorism, and then portraying as villains the people who show genuine concern for their countries' security and future.

I once stumbled upon a March issue of Newsweek, with the headline "homegrown terrorism." I expected that they will address the issue of American young people going to the MidEast to join ISIS. It turned out that the "homegrown terrorists" referred to American citizens exercising their 2nd Amendment rights in case of a terrorist attack. They were labelled as "right-wing radical extremists". One of the reasons why the American people don't trust the mainstream media (or at least what Ted Cruz said when he roasted the biased debate moderator).
