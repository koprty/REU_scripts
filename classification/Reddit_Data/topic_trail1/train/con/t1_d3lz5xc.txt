&gt; most cases end in a plea bargain with a lesser charge

Yes and this is bad. over 95 percent of cases are plead out - pushes innocent people to take deals instead of facing trial. Why would you face trial on a murder charge, potentially facing death penalty, when you could plea down to something like felony burglary and serve ~10 years or less; even if you are innocent that is a tough choice and many choose to plea, adding to our over populated prisons. Especially given that 1 in 25 inmates we have ALREADY executed have been proven innocent after the DNA has come back. 

Fun fact, there are more people on the waiting list for drug treatment programs in federal prisons than actually enrolled, you would think the state would make this a priority to deter future crime - apparently not.

Our state's prison and legal system has a lot of problems, one of which is over-incarceration being just one. That is my point. 

&gt; The myth of people going to proson because they have weed in their pocket is persistent. 

I never once made that argument.
