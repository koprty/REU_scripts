Renewable energy receives billions in subsidies and is bad.  Fossil Fuels receive approximately 3x at many subsidies but they are more well tucked into long standing processes so we don't see them.

Plus the liberals like solar so its bad.  

Honestly, its stupid.  If you look at who owns the manufacturing plants and the patents on Solar, and have an inkling of what the energy road map is going to look like in 20 years Conservatives should be standing around chest thumping about solar.  Unless we develop nuclear fusion in the short term, with the current and dropping cost of Solar provide it a crushing margin of superiority.  

I'm a conservative, we all are here, but there is a layer of pragmatism that I like to filter on top of my worldview.  In a perfect world, we would let Solar do its thing and it will eventually win because free energy from the sky.  In reality, politics complicates things.  Domestically, Coal has a huge lobby and they actively do things to slow the implementation of Solar because it will kill their business model.  Fracking, and the cheap natural gas it provides, are already doing a number on them and Solar on top of that basically ends them as a key player in the energy industry in ten years.  They know it will, it has done so elsewhere.  Internationally, China subsidizes their home grown Solar industry heavily because they are trying to compete with us and there will be an ENORMOUS Solar market in a few years.  Planned economies will never work as effectively as Free Market, however if a Planned economy(China) sees an obvious target(Solar) they can inefficiently throw enormous resources behind an industry.  So to compete, the US government has to pick winners and losers which I detest, but I detest the alternative of buying Chinese Solar Cells more.
