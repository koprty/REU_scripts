Trump says he supports the 2nd admendment, Hillary wants to change it.

Unfortunately, both Trump and Hillary are serial liars. Both have had statements supporting and opposing gun control.  Therefore, the odds of conservatives (not talking about you trump supporters) liking the outcome is roughly equal with both of them.

Fortunately, Hillary unites the GOP in opposition.  Makes the choice pretty clear for the thinking conservative.  NeverTrump.
