From the article:

&gt; Officials say Obama won't apologize for the decision to use an atomic bomb, which many historians insist was necessary to hasten the end of World War II and save lives. 

Talk about revisionist history.  They just sneak that in there like it's a mainstream view.  Do they really think their readers are dumb enough to believe that?
