I think this is the best case for Rubio if he has any more major political aspirations in the near future. He can win reelection but has stated he doesnt plan on running. A VP spot could easily lead to a POTUS 8 years down the road if Trumps years are not a shit show(and I don't think they will be). It works well for Rubio really. If he is the VP pick he will help pick up a bit more of the latino vote, he is young which will contrast well on Trumps age. No worries of the VP kicking the bucket if the POTUS does. Then if things go well during Trumps 8 years(assuming he wins of course) he would have a viable chance at running. He would be 52, have solid experience and be able to make history as the first latino president. And if Trump loses, well Rubio was already on his way out of politics.
