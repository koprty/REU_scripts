She is a liar and possibly one of the worst possible canidates to ever run for president.  There is not a single position she has that I favor.

But she unites the GOP in opposition and Trump is too unstable to EVER be president.  I dispise Hillary, but I fear Trump as the best case scenario is that he is just as bad as her and the worst case scenario is that he starts a global trade war.

Thus, I will vote for the most conservative 3rd party candidate that I can.  Under absolutely no circumstances will I ever vote for Trump. Never. Ever. Trump.
