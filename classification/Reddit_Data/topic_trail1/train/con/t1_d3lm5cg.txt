I guess we're not sick and tired of hearing about her emails after all, are we, Bernie?

 I've been amused/astounded at the r/politics crowd. A year ago the email thing was a horrible attempt by right wing conspirators to discredit Hillary. Since they're on the Bernie bandwagon, though, the last few months have been nothing but article after article on how she should be in prison. So much for right-wing nutjobs.  

After three or four reports, it seems the mainstream liberals can't ignore it anymore. How many does it take before we actually indict her?
