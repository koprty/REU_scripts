I like that he says he'll lower taxes on everyone (he hasn't flopped on that, the media misquoted him) and build a stronger border. I also agree with him that a lot of social issues should be up to the states, that's a huge thing for me. 

Another reason I like him is that I had zero faith in the other candidates. The establishment always gets into office and then forgets who put them there. 

I wanted an outsider, who at least I could trust them to be them. I started out liking Carson, and after what Cruz did to him I couldn't vote for him. I trust Ben, and when he endorsed Trump that's when I began to take a better look at him. 

I believe it would have been worse for my convictions (which I have to break all the time in the ballot box...Romney) if I voted for Ted who consistently lied about Trumps policies. That's also why I think so much division is taking place in the conservative movement. They tried to paint Trump as Hitler to beat him, but when you see Ted Cruz say "Trump said this!" When he said the exact opposite it makes it hard to vote for him as a conservative.
