Yes, but in reality, the Business Judgment Rule insulates directors and officers from liability and grants them considerable autonomy. To use legal-speak, the standard they use is about as soft as the "rational basis test" -- all you need is nominal articulation of the fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder value. A company could literally say that we want to give 50% of our profits to charity because we think the good PR will generate long term sustainable value and that's enough. If they said that we want to give 50% of our profits to charity despite the fact that we strongly believe that this will adversely affect our shareholders, then there could be issues.
