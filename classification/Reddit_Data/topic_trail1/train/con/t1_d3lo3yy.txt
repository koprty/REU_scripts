So... this blindness to Clinton by lots of people in this thread and elsewhere...

It it because these people are in their 20s and were either not born or little kids when all the accusations came up? Is it because it wasn't covered by the media the people watch? I'm 35 and was a teenager in the 90s. Maybe it's because of the media I was exposed to, but I remember that Clinton had loooooooots of accusers against him ranging from indecent exposure to rape.

And yeah, now we have the recent story tying Clinton to trips with a sex-slaving pedophile.

How is this not basically universal knowledge? I'm not saying that his guilt in every case is universally proven. I'm just asking how the accusations are not more well known?
