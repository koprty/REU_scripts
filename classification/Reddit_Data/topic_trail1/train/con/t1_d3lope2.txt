They hyper aggressively pursue what I've termed the "Failure Vote".  It's how you can hear a President say, "You didn't build that." - to make failures think success is all luck knowing the secret handshake.

Any successful group - that doesn't vote for them - is the devil.

Personal responsibility, education, useful training?  That's for other people.
