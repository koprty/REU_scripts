I don't think that delusion is the right word, the current science would indicate a genetic link as well as an environmental one (I.e. related to the mothers hormones during gestation).

If that's true, then it's a developmental disorders, which, while a mental disorder, would not be described as a delusion. You can fix a delusion, you can't really unwind the development of a brain that develops in a nonstandardized way, if that makes sense?
