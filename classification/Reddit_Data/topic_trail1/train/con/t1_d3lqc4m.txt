It's unsustainable not because it's totalitarian; Ancient Roman Culture lasted 753 BC. - 1453 AD and through that there were varying degrees of totalitarianism. It's unsustainable because it tries to kill all culture and religion and not replace it with anything. The lifeblood of civilization is culture and religion, and nature abhors a vaccum. Roman civilization lasted so long despite so many upheavals due to the basic strength of it's culture.

Trying to commit cultural suicide, most noticably during China's Cultural Revolution is civilizational suicide. Which is why I theorize the ultimate Strength of Russian Civilization vs. Chinese, despite the apparent, extremely dramatic, difference in wealth at the moment.

This is a basic point of Edmund Burke (Father of Conservatism), in my opinion. He was able to observe a remarkably similar situation to the Communist revolutions with the French Revolution.
