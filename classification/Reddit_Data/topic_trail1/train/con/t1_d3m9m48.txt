So we are back to over incarceration? I thought violent people were running free because of the war on drugs? Im having difficulty keeping up with your narrative circles... Lets wrap this up...

Almost noone is in prison for non violent drug crimes
Those that are in prison are mostly drug dealers
The few remaining for only possesion are such a small amount 3.7% that its a non factor and most likely the left over from the plea bargains that are the majority of convictions
We have a lot of violent people in prison. Where they belong.
