The funniest part is how many Bernie supporters followed his lead about the "damn e-mails" and haven't brought them back up...until now. Fake Black Guy Shaun King is so DISGUSTED with the e-mail story. He said he spent the past 24 hours studying the report despite it not being out that long at the time of said tweet. 

This guy has no credibility at all. He finally, after dragging his feet, got this story right. I can't stand this guy from his crap with Peyton Manning. Using the nut job's plaintiff petition which was one sided to smear Peyton after his boy Cam Newton lost and was a bitch about it. Anyways, he's a white guy pretending to be black. He stole money from a charity. He interviewed for a job with Jason Whitlock, who couldn't verify many of his claims. He's a loser. I venture over to his Twitter account to see how "disgusted" or "furious" about things that happen. He's desperate now that Bernie isn't gonna be the nominee.
