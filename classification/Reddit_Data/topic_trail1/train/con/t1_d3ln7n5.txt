&gt; A cis person is a person who was assigned a gender and sex at birth that they feel comfortable with. Typically, cis men are men who were assigned male at birth and feel that the words "man" and "male" accurately describe who they are.

Read through some of it and noticed them using the term "CIS".  

This is the liberal way.  Even though transgender people are mentally ill, they will try to change the language.  So instead of normal people and mentally sick transgender people the normal people are now put into another group no longer referred to as normal but "CIS."
