I'd love to see Bernie beat her in California.  I think it's still possible for him to almost tie her in actual votes and then have the shill super delegates put her over the top.  Everything is trending for the Bernie people to not vote, vote for a 3rd party, or even to vote for Trump just to screw hillary.  I love it.
