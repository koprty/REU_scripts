However you're oversimplifying something that you don't understand -- that no one understands. Modern science has yet to decipher the phenomenon of gender dysphoria. In my opinion, yes surgery is very invasive and I'm not sure whether or not it is the correct answer to the mental illness but it's the most effective treatment we've got. I'd cite the review that claims this but I'm not on my laptop, will update with it. Antidepressants and other similar drugs are not as effective. It is very naive to just tell someone "just deal with it" when it is a real biological deviation from normal human behaviour with very real physical and mental symptoms such as other diseases have. This doesn't mean these people are lesser than us, just unfortunately not born with the same "normalness". With all this being said, we need more research into gender identity but ethics in the way, I don't think we'll ever get it in time.

Also, I'd like to add, once gender dysphoria is treated by surgery, these people often feel marginalized by society once transitioned, leaving them more likely to be depressed and suicidal. I'd love to discover a way to make themselves feel at peace with their born genders without surgery.
