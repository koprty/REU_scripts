Modern Conservativism is based off of liberty, fisical responsibility, international leadership, and traditional values. Trump wants to curtail the 1st amendment with his libel laws which is a direct attack on liberty. He wants to levy massive tax cuts along with massive new spending projects blowing up the deficit and debt which is a directly counter to fisical responsibility. He has already begun alienating our closest European ally (Britain) and Asian allies (Japan &amp; SK) which demonstrates a real possibility of killing American leadership abroad. Finally his philandering, adultery and complete lack of decorum shows his distaste for traditional values. In no way is The Donald conservative, which is why I'm glad many of his followers have begun using the term alt-right to describe themselves. Hopefully they won't completely taint the conservative movement.
