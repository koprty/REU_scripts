Then the only reason those kids would be born is that their mother couldn't abort them. What kind of a mother would she be to that kid? Combine this with banning contraception and sex education and you're gonna get dumpsters full of babies and orphanages full of kids. Some lives are not worth living in my opinion.

edit: and don't tell me that a woman could find herself pregnant, but doesnt want to have a baby and then throws herself down the stairs a couple of times to induce an abortion but that doesnt work and ends up giving birth to the baby anyway. Do you really think she's gonna change her mind afterwards?
