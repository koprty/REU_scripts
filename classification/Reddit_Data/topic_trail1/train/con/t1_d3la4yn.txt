I'm starting my own eco-cult.  If you have the money to give me, I'll take it to "donate" to a good eco-cause (my car's gas tank because, have you seen the damage caused by mining the materials for a Prius battery?, my wallet so that I can fund hollow and pointless protests that honestly don't need much funding), and only women can join and must be at least a 5 on the 1 - 10 hot scale, because some of my eco-warrior causes might require bikinis and/or nudism.  And the sex stuff...oh lord, just see how creative I can get to convince them that orgies and threeways are some eco cause.
