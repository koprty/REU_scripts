The regulatory control is the market setting the price. Good old supply and demand. When prices are high its a calling basically saying that supply is lacking and demand is great, more research will go into obtaining this resource from harder to get places (oils an example), or alternatives will appear (electric car which is a new economy of batteries and researching into that and electric motors and production and now training to work on them). The issue people have with capitalism is understanding the market, prices are related to supply and demand, our government unfortunately sets a lot of prices and manipulates them by being in the market thus causing higher prices without the markets ability to correct them with alternatives or more supply. Often case when government is involved in the marketplace there is no incentive to improve or decrease prices.
