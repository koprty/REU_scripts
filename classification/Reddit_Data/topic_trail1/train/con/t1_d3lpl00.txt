Interesting.

Accounting BS but Interesting.  Problem with this viewpoint is that given how our government works and how deeply connected the Fossil Fuel industries are to our nation's prosperity, if they weren't getting 'favorable tax treatment' I'd be worried.  Walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and such.  Again, Fossil Fuels receive approximately 3x as many subsidies (as renewables) but they are more well tucked into long standing processes so we don't see them.  

For example, when Fracking got huge around my home I could drive around and see oil rig after oil rig going up.  None of them were from 'big oil', they were all 'independent'.  However, a quick search determined that they were all basically cut aways from 'big oil' to designed to maximize each stage of oil production's profits.  That's what capitalism is all about.  Each of them would be classified as an independent oil producer, and each of them was tied at the hip to a major producer.  So they get every tax benefit described in your article for 'small producers' and 'big oil' gets to make money too.  That's great.  

I just don't entertain a significant difference between cutting your tax bill by one million and flat giving you one million.  Neither should happen.  Both do.
