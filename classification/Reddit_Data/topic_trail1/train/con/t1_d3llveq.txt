Journalism is all about what to leave in, what to leave out. If there is an epidemic of urban crime, leave that out. If a criminal dies after violently confronting a cop, leave out everything but the fact some poor unarmed child died at the hands of an angry armed police officer. Then, the journalist will relentlessly flog that fact until black smoke blots out the city skyline. Then they will report on the resultant riot and looting as an epic story of oppressed people rising to shake off their chains.

The tradition of editing out anything that doesn't support the narrative is old as the dried cow pies in the hill country of Texas. Dan Rather used his position to try and influence an election with slander, lies and damned lies. He left out the fact he was manufacturing his news story from faked documents. CNN once reported how US Army forces used nerve gas in Vietnam while editing out the fact the entire story was complete fabrication based on fictional musing of a serial liar. Rolling Stone made up a phony rape story because the real rapists in this world aren't of a type that would help bash the patriarchy.

The professionals in the press like to present themselves as objective reporters. That presentation of course leaves out the fact their primary purpose is to produce paid partisan political propaganda.
