I haven't been sarcastic or antagonistic like you people. I stated my opinion that I think religions are stupid, but that I'm not so antagonistic that I feel the need to belittle you for thinking different. The only reason I even said anything about it is because you're all jumping on my back for trying to open up thoughtful discussion.
