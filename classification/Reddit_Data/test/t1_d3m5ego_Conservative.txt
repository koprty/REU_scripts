Would you say the first point is valid of people who are classical liberals or liberals who are not necessarily progressive? I find a good amount of people I know personally who vote Democrat just because they are for gay marriage, abortions, etc. but don't necessarily care about the whole BLM and the whole marginalizing minorities part.
