There were never 60 votes for single payer in the Senate, and it's not clear there were enough votes for it in the House either.  And we only held those 60 votes for about 120 working days and only then if we wheeled out a dying Ted Kennedy or a dying Robert Byrd out for a vote.  Once Scott Brown was seated in February 2010, the Democrats could no longer override the filibuster.

Given the way legislation moves through the Senate, Obama realistically had time for 1 or 2 bills, and he got them - The ACA and the ARRA.
