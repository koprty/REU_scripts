Just be your own person and don't blindly subscribe to any one group/person's ideas or policies. Most importantly, don't make politics your life. The rest will work itself out. If you're endlessly ranting on FB out political stuff, you're too involved. That's the biggest mistake extreme liberals make... They're obsessed. Like children, they try to force the world to work the way they *think* it should, rather than deal with the way it actually does work. And when anybody tries to tell them something doesn't work that way, they have a tantrum and label you one of the terrible people ruining the planet. The western world hasn't had to experience true hardship for generations now. Young people are living with no real understanding of how bad things can really get. They're told the big evil conservatives are the root of all evil. They have no idea what evil even is.
