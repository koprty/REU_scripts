I'm really stunned to see someone who purports to want to influence the Democratic party call our current Democratic President corrupt simply because he compromised in order to accomplish his goals.  It seems you don't understand how hard people worked to get him elected twice and what a huge insult it is to call him corrupt.

And I never called you stupid, just ignorant.  There's a big difference.
