It's obviously blindly voting. Don't buy into this false dichotomy, because all it does is prop up the 1%. Why should you or I or anyone vote for a candidate who doesn't have share our interests or values? There are better candidates than hillary out there, vote for them! You're simply allowing the DNC to be a corporatist puppet
