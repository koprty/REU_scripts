Yet then you'd go the high road and call me, condescendingly, the same thing (stupid, naieve, etc.). Because I'm principled does not make me naive. I agree that the ACA is a good step in the right direction, but it is nowhere near good enough. And the only reason Obama didn't push more, is because of his corruption. Don't get me wrong, since his first term he has gotten unprecedented obstructionism, preventing him from doing anything, but he could have gotten something better than the ACA
