My favorite thing to do is compulsively fact check claims people make and point out when they need a bit more to back up their position or trying to keep a discussion on track by pointing out individuals relying on insults, emotion, or common misinformation and assumptions.

What does liberal mean to me? As a mod it would mean nothing. My goal would be to keep discussions productive and civil much as a moderator at a debate would. My role would not be to influence opinion one way or another, but rather to keep things grounded in reality and foster better communication between differing opinions.

As a person I am too fiscally conservative and value personal privacy too much claim a political party. When it comes to social issues I am too liberal to really claim either party again. Social issues are used as a wedge to drive between two sides of the American people. 

The fact that our opinions and beliefs are not black and white, but exist on a spectrum means nothing to either party. If the population were to actually start having real conversations with each other many people's minds would be blown with how much they actually have in common. Those are the connections I would strive to facilitate.

Any way, I am not around these parts enough to be considered seriously, but I did want to put forth a different idea of how a moderator on a politically focused sub could go about their duties.
