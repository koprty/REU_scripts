Look I like Obama, but it's pretty clear that he is somewhat corrupt. I can't believe that there's someone who believes that you can't criticize the Democratic president even though I'm a liberal. And Obama didn't just compromise, he started with the compromises and then compromised again basically giving the Republicans what they wanted.
