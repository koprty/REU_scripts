Sanders has been building something beyond a presidential campaign, he is offering Americans a new deal, and as expected not everyone wants to take it at once. And you say that to go in without super-PACs is to unilaterally disarm. Yet he and Clinton have raised the same amount, proving that Clinton or anyone could have run without the backing of super-pacs. This defense of supporting the establishment in order to protect against the threat of trump is a defense of a system that has spurned people like me and I'm sure you as well. I cannot defend a system, supreme court nominations and CU aside, in order to save myself from it.
