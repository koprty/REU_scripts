While I agree that the DNC lost independents, there is also a sizable chunk of the party membership (sanders voters, about a third of them, so let's say a conservative 15% of democrats) are Bernie or Bust and until November can't be counted on for hillary. This is what I mean by a toss up. Trump has managed to have the party fall behind him despite multiple efforts to stop him, whole hillary is loosing support from her own party. It's a toss up because no one can difinitivly say either will win in November because polls have them tied or hillary losing and multiple extraneous factors (email scandal, trumps inability to fundraise) mean that both canidate will have a hard time getting above 50 percent of the vote as of today. Anything can change and I could be proven wrong, but for you to come at me with personal attacks instead of explaining your reasoning shuts down discussion and does no service to you or I.
