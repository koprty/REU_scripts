All I'm saying i can't vote for Hillary. She is not a liberal and does not represent my values. Nor has she done anything to make me think she is on the side progress. I do not want the status quo and will not vote for it. My third party vote may be a wasted, but I will vote my conscious. Lesser of two evils is still evil. If Trump wins, I will not be afraid and run away. I will continue to speak out for liberal policy and support liberal candidates. It's funny that whenever a democrat is in office the anti-war movement dies. Why? The democrats are not the party of the working class or peace.
