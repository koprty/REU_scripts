Yes, some situations call for you to set aside your own self interest for the benefit of others, that's ethics. I think we have a cultural tendency in the US to conflate efficiency with morality. In this case, Trump didn't cause the market crash that he took advantage of, and so the only action  I had a gripe with was his expressed excitement about a situation that was ruining a lot of lives because it was going to benefit him. Even saying that by itself isn't necessarily unethical, it just seems to be a strong indicator of a worldview that habitualizes immoral behavior. You have to consider too that "self interest" is extremely nonspecific. When acting in your own self interest entails literally doing what you have to do to survive and feed your family, then you probably have several more morally permissible routes to achieving that than someone who's acting in their own self interest by trying to tack a few extra million onto an already sizable fortune. If you can do that without trampling people who are struggling then more power to you, if not then what you're doing is wrong.

At the end of the day I bet we probably just have different views on what our moral obligations to other people are, but hopefully that gives you a good snapshot of my perspective.
