While I agree with your last paragraph, and it was well stated by the way I thank you for your honesty, I do take issue with the first. Hillary, as it was proven during some recent email revaluation as well as financial records shows that all the funding she did for downballot canidates was a front to bypass the maximum donations for her campaign. I urge you to look into the "downballot" defense further and I think you will find it to be fishy in the least. And yes, sure a billionaire can swamp sanders and his small donations instantly, but is that a good enough reason to support someone who took that money willingly in the first place.
