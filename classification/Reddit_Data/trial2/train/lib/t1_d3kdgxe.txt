That's just not the truth though.  I went to a trump rally in central fl and I've never witnessed anyone act like the "protesters". They spit on the Trump supporters,  yelled obscenities, and burned the US flag. After the rally was over they wouldn't let us leave.  They through rocks at cars and fought with the police.  It's not just a few drunk people.  The people who go protest Trump are there to be violent.
