Sanders is a movement, not a campaign. I don't think we're going to see the same thing happen this year as it did in 2008 especially after Obama basically dropped any and every ball he had when he was elected - people are not interested in establishment politics anymore. They see what happens when hope and change transform to status quo and incremental 'change'.

This isn't to say that no one is going to go from Sanders to Clinton, just that the conditions from the two elections are a bit different.
