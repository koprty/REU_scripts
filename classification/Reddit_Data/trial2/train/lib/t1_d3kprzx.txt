Partly by not taking the polls seriously at this point.  Hillary has been attacked for decades, Bernie has barely been attacked at all.  Trump wants to throw Whitewater at Hillary, from the 1970s.  You know what Bernie was up to in the 1970s?  Talking about how bad parenting could cause cancer, fluoridated water and public schooling were a threat to freedom, little kids should touch each sexually to kill porn, and how awesome the Cultural Revolution was.  More recently, he voted to block the CDC from researching gun violence, and to immunize gun manufacturers from lawsuits.

Hillary's dirty laundry has been waved from the rooftops.  Bernie's has barely been disturbed.
