&gt; now gets 1/300th of the pay of a CEO.

Thats not true, Thats only true if you're talking about a non random sample of the fortune 500 CEO's. IF you're talking about the typical CEO, which makes about 185,000 Per year, Only makes about 4-7 times the average worker, which is still a heck of a lot, but lets use more nationally representative statistics.
