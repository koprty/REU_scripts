Right - Congress swings back and forth all the time. But that's not what's being argued with the "Elect Trump and the outrage will get us a true progressive" argument. The incumbent has a significant advantage when it comes to winning the *Presidency*, so I don't buy this idea of "Well if Trump is elected, liberal outrage will be strong enough for us to get a real progressive President, so there's no reason to vote for Hillary Clinton." If Trump wins one term, he's statistically likely to win a second one as well.
