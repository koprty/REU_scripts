Sanders and Clinton have raised the same amount directly, but Clinton has raised a great deal more for downballot races which she couldn't have done using Sanders' methods.  And we haven't even gotten into the general yet and Sanders fundraising is starting to slow down significantly.  Given that a single crazy right wing billionaire can dump a fortune in dark money at any time, Sanders 40 million a month could be swamped in 10 seconds.

I understand that you don't want to defend a system which you don't feel works for you, but the truth is that it's never going to work for you if you refuse to engage.  Voting for someone who represents many of your interests, but not all of them, doesn't make you a corrupt sellout, and maybe it gives you the opportunity to influence the person to come around on your differences.  It's certainly more than you'll get from the other side who will actively work to undermine your interests and take away the things you value.
