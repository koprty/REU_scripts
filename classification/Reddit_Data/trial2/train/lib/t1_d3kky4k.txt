&gt; [quoting the source:] "did not comply with the department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act"

Okay, but from that he concludes that she violated law. This seems to be a significant jump that neither CNN nor NPR make and that Levin does not support as far as I can tell. Violating policy can reasonably be seen a breach of the spirit of the law, but if such policy violations do not also violate the letter of the law, then calling such an action "criminal" requires substantive support that Levin does not offer.

Of course, this is talk radio, so Levin soon thereafter advocates for a denial of lgbt rights while misgendering trans people. He seems (like much of conservative talk radio) to be conducting this show under an expectation from his audience to come out against liberals/liberalism on whatever topic he discusses.

Suffice it to say, I'm finding this guy to be neither a persuasive nor reputable source, and certainly not one who attempts dispassionate engagement with the facts of the email case.
