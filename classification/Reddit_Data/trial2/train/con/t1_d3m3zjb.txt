Previously we used to cut trees for energy until the shift to coal, then to oil and gas and now electricity, each time harming the environment less and less, since each progressing method provides more energy per lb moved thus costs less to produce. 

I didnt claim not to be for any regulations this is where you have it wrong, we need common sense regulations. Wildlife preserves and nature set aside from man is fine with me. 

Clearly somethings need to be regulated that are common sense and would apply to both people and business, such as not dumping oil into a river. Neither a person changing their own car oil nor should a company be allowed to dump into a river. Again common sense regulations. I know you are trying to find some edge or way to debate me, but realize I want the same thing but with common sense approaches.
