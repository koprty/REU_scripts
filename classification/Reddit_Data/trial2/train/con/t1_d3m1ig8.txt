&gt; They grow trees now like we farm corn

Now they do.   Previously, we used to clear cut for any old reason.  Then 'environmentalists' and other regulatory-oriented people threw a shit. 

Your animal argument is not this issue.  I don't have any intrinsic reason to stop people from raising Rhinos in captivity, breeding them, etc.  Certain things would probably be better this way (albeit having more animal cruelty from slaughter-for-horns... but we eat meat, too, so..)

But certain scales of 'product' involve whole ecosystems, like forests, or seas (fishing).  

What do we do about the endangered things?  And the things that we want to see remain in place and undamaged by collateral usages?  Do those go away because the market has  no use for them?
but now you say

&gt; so you get better and safer results when its regulated properly

so it sounds like you were for regulation all this time, not letting the free market automatically-self-regulate?
