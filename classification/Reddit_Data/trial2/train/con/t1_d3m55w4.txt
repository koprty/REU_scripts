I see two things when I see people proclaim themselves "liberals".

* They believe in equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity.
 * This is the crux of modern progressive political thoughts, that all else should be put to the wayside until we can ensure each demographic *feels* equal, regardless of the metrics we are able to observe in reality, the demographics must *feel* equal. This is evidenced by the fact that BLM and such are [pushing for segregation](http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/261912/black-lives-matter-banning-racial-segregation-daniel-greenfield), a step **BACKWARDS** by most classic liberal thought. It's not enough that we are able to not be segregated anymore and that we are able to come together across races for discussions...no, that's not enough, we need to have segregated discussions because...jeez I don't even know how the reconcile this train of thought, honestly.
* They believe in being fiscally liberal at a government level because of perceived issues in private sector that do not support the point above.
 * i.e. we need to be fiscally liberal because corporations are profiting while the middle class is shrinking. They reject that these perceived differences could be due to our trade and economic policies. Here it's not a racial inequality but a socioeconomic inequality, and if you disagree that anyone rich was privileged to begin with then you are now part of the problem and admonished as such, prepare for the moral grandstanding in 3...2...

It's certainly interesting. On the conservative side we have splitering from traditional conservative thought into Libertarian, Neo and Paleoconservatism, to name a few. Liberals have also now splintered into Classic Liberals (which OP seems to fit into, though may be drawing away from), Progressives, and now there seems to be a resurgence of socialists even!

What a time to be alive.
