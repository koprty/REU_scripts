Actually the free market handles this quite well.. If you do your own research its often suggested that animals and plants be taken off the endangered species list, which would cause greedy people to breed them and sell them for less. Its not my morality to compare a rhino to a cow, but one is illegal to breed for food and parts and the later is not and in cheap and full supply and without risk to cows becoming a victim of extinction. Trust me if the market would pay $50-100k (made up) for a rhino you bet your asshole that some company would come along and breed them until they were as plentiful as cows, or alternatives will be found (maybe they only needed meet not a mystery Asian cure and chickens will work)

Again higher prices slow demand, thus the free market preserves rare items form being wasted by placing a high value on them. So when rhino supply is low prices will be in high demand thus less people will buy a rhino

If you want to use trees well it incentives producers to plant more trees. But if you look at history and want to talk specifically about trees, lets take a walk back in history. Britain was basically built on lumber industry and nearly wiped all the trees out, and looked to America as a new resource for trees. Then coal came along and took over, and now the trees are back, and during the goal time it was the same fear of running out and high prices that we hear about today with oil/gas, the reality is oil/gas and coal are not as limited as we think of as a resource, and we already have the next technology transfer in place. Which over history its easy to see in energy we keep going to more efficient method that are better for the environment the faster the free market evolves, east vs west Germany another example of how quickly capitalism cleaned up one side and was better for the environment than the west.
