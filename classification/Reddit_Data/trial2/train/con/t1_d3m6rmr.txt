Well that $11,000 a year amount was a number that the Fraser Institute came up with which is a conservative think tank so one can imagine they would lean more conservative in their findings (the same way a liberal think tank would lean more liberal). 

Secondly i'd wager you would be right that if Canadians had to write a check to their government for it they wouldn't love it as much... until they have a health issue and then see the bill related to that in which they would promptly say "shit tax me and give me my universal healthcare back asap!".
