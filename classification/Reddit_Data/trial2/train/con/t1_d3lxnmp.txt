Just start with principles first.  I believe in individual liberty, free market capitalism and limited government.  I came to those beliefs after years of reading and research about historical policies and what has/has not worked in the past, as well as my own logic and reasoning on various topics.   Given that, the GOP is the party that sometimes represents and advances those principles - often not.  The Democrats almost never advance them.
