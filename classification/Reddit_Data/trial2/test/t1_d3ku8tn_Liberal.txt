Ok, well I would say the reason that there have been few attack ADS against him is because the media ( many of whom are top hillary contributors) have done the job of negatively portraying sanders at nearly every turn. And you bring up Citizens United, the case that said that money=speach in campaign finance and was brought up by an anti-hillary group, is that supposed to absolve her use of money in politics, or at least her tacit support of money in politics? Because it seems to me if she cared about money in politics like she says she does then she would not be raising money the way she is. And before might say she had no choice or that that is the reality, remeber the Sanders has out-raised the Clinton Machine 4 months in a row and all without bundling, super-PACs or any sketchy or otherwise dubious means.
