I think part of the issue here is that Trump doesn't really care about social issues all that much in the context of what he wants to get done as president. As far as I know, he has not brought them up at all at rallies or in policy papers.

He only talks about them when he gets directly pushed during interviews, like the bathroom thing and the abortion question.

On the other hand, you can go back to the 80's and find videos of him basically giving his current stump speech on trade and general foreign policy. I think that's probably all he really cares about in a very specific way.

I think he will be fairly squishy on social issues other than using them as a way to bargain and coalition build for getting his actual agenda items pushed through.
