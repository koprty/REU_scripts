I didn't say it didn't. Just that people who support a dead soldier vs one who is alive and against your own political views can be seen to cause issues, hence why they may come off hypocritically because they do not want to shine light on Kerry's better achievements. The medal of honor doesn't seem to be what Kerry has though nor does Kyle, so I don't know where that is going. Way to be a good representation of your views though. I applaud it.
