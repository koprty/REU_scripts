It has happened almost every time since the civil war, why would not it happened again? I mean if trump policy are so bad then the country will realize their mistake and stop the menacing policies from taking effect. So if Trump wins then what? This subbreddit will change its name to moderates and we will seek to get the center right like Clinton/Obama? How will my vote change any of this? I mean I live in TN, chances of Clinton winning my state are pretty close to nil. My vote really doesn't matter much.
