You're saying she broke the law, but the article you provide concludes:

 &gt; The bottom line is this: No one will likely ever know what was deleted from Clinton's server. Barring one of the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department being deemed "classified," it's also unlikely she will ever be found to have violated the letter of the law.

Is there evidence elsewhere that she broke the letter rather than the spirit of the law? Even today's [CNN piece](http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/26/opinions/clinton-email-server-ig-report-opinion-cox/index.html) on the issue says that "criminal charges still remain highly unlikely." It remains a huge problem for her campaign with respect to public opinion, of course.
