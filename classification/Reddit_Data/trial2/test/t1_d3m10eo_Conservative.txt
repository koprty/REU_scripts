Which is just a cop out to make the conservative position on abortion palatable for more people.  Because as soon as you start putting pretty young women in jail, sympathy for the pro-life stance will evaporate.

How, exactly, is a woman who goes to an abortion clinic, asks for an abortion, and then gets exactly what she asked for a victim? At any time, she could have walked out. I've yet to hear of a case where a woman is tied down by a doctor and forced to have an abortion against her will. 
(There are certainly cases of women being under duress from their boyfriends, etc., but that's very different from claiming all women who get abortions are victims of their doctors.)

And the National Review symposium is unpersuasive. The arguments there boil down to: Poor little woman doesn't know what she's doing. Big bad doctor-man knows he's a murderer and delights in it.
