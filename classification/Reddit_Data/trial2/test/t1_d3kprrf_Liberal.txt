Full disclosure: I'm right of center.

I never understood this argument.  We live in a capitalist, free market system firmly rooted in individuality.  If market conditions exist such that you can "buy low" to later "sell high", how is this wrong?  Why is it wrong to seek out such conditions (most would call it "finding value")?  In fact, most transactions that people engage in involve asymmetry of information and winners/losers.  Are we supposed to just set aside our own personal interest and not hustle because we feel bad for other people???
