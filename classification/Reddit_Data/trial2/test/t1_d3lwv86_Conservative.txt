As a Florida resident, I'm not sure I want Rubio to run. I would certainly vote for him if he did, but I would rather see someone a little more conservative. According to [this](https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Florida,_2016), Ron DeSantis is running for Rubio's seat. He's my congressman from Flagler County. He's a good conservative, and I would like to see him run instead.
