That sounds nice for breedable animals, but you can't breed a forest ecosystem the same way.  Giant trees are definitively *not* back, as we keep cutting the largest for market-sales.  Nor does it work-out that removing all animals from natural systems, in order to protectively breed them, so that their natural habitat can be regularly harvested for profit.  Wetland animal-insect systems are a demonstration of this.

Further on that point is the existence of [medicine] plants, sometimes of which are not understood by the timbering company - who is there to timber, not harvest or glean other 'products'.
