I dunno I kinda think the rape of nanjing occurred because of humanity's worst instincts. Also Comfort Women, which is not as cute and cuddly as it sounds (forced prostitution).

And not you know nuking two cities just to convince a country that worships their leader as a literal god to stop fighting.

I kinda think if you're facing off against a god emperor, you gotta do it big. Which means overrunning their divinity by splitting atoms.
